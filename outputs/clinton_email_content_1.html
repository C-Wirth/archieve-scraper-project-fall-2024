</span>
Madame Secretary:

I wanted to make you current on our pending extradition request for Walid Makled, a Venezuelan national now in
custody in Colombia.

Makled is a major narcotrafficker; he was arrested in Colombia in August based on DEA information. Shortly thereafter,
both Venezuela and the US requested his extradition. Starting in mid-October, Makled, speaking to the media from jail,

alleged that senior Venezuelan government officials, including many generals, were complicit in his narcotrafficking
enterprise. Makled has repeated these allegations over the past few days, and made clear he would prefer to        be
extradited to the United States.

Following Colombian President Santos' visit to Venezuela last week, Venezuelan President Chavez publicly claimed that

Santos had agreed to give Makled to Venezuela. Chavez claimed that the US and Makled were conspiring to get Makled
to the United States so that he would have a platform to make further allegations about Venezuelan government
involvement in narcotics smuggling.

Worried about Chavez' comments, DOJ and DEA reached out to the Department to request that we raise the issue with
the GOC. DOJ and DEA focused on Makled's importance as a narcotrafficker and on the possibility that he could provide

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772919 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

useful information on Venezuelan government involvement in drug smuggling. Ambassador McKinley spoke face to face

with Santos on Nov 8, underlining our interest in Makled's extradition and in ensuring that our request was properly
reviewed. Santos signaled that the decision had gone in the other direction, and that he felt he'd gone "too far down
that path to reverse course."

On Nov 8 and Nov 9, we became aware of the interest of Rep Mack in the case. I spoke with Mack on Nov 9, saying we
were aware of the matter and have engaged with the GOC on it. I told him that I would get back to him after further

inquiries.

On Nov 10, Amb McKinley spoke with Santos' chief of staff, Juan Pinzon, repeating our strong interest in Makled and our

insistence that our request be properly reviewed. Pinzon confirmed that Santos has made the decision and feels he
cannot reverse course. He further indicated that Santos was aware of the DOJ and Hill concerns, and that he had

directed Colombian Amb Silva to speak with Mack.

Pinzon affirmed that the extradition processes would be respected, and that there would be no precipitous deportation

or removal to Venezuela. As a practical matter this means Makled would remain for several months in Colombia, and
that the US would have full access to Makled throughout that period.

There is some relevant political analysis that I would prefer to share in a different channel; I would be happy to meet
with you to lay out these additional facts. I am flying back to Washington tonight after meetings w President Lugo in
Paraguay and Mujica in Uruguay.

Best Regards,

Arturo

Thx. Ifeel the same way! Just got off a call with usaid, srap and my team. We are drafting a response. I think we need

something firm, accurate and rapid. Still deciding who will sign and whether it will be an op ed or letter to the editor. I
want to be sure we avoid a public battle with the ngo community on this issue. UsAID is recommending that Raj meet

with Worthington and read him the riot act for the op ed.

Will forward the draft before we send.

8TW, USAID    confirmed that there was no USG branding in the attacks Worthington references.

I agree. As you know I believe passionately that it is not in our national interests to continue to provide billions of dollars

in aid and assistance without the very people we are helping knowing we are the ones providing the assistance. Some of
our research in Pakistan indicates that many people believe the assistancee is     coming from China and of course the

Chinese do nothing to correct the record.

I asked INR to provide me with an assessment of the current situation after the floods to determine the impact of our
assistance. I have also asked them to work with the IC to give us an accurate and unbiased assessment of the security
risks involved. I aksed for it couple of weeks ago so hopefully they will have something we can use now which might be

helpful in drafting a response.

In terms of the security arguments he makes, it    is worth
                                                            noting that the incidents he references are situations where the
attacks occured in places where there was NO USG branding. The reality       isthat the terrorists attack any group or
institution which might impede their ability to prevail.

I had already planned a USAID/State meeting to address this      issue this week. I'll try to get everyone together today or
tomorrow and will report back to you.

Interaction op-ed that Raj Shah was told will appear in the Washington Post also appeared in Sunday Daily Times in
Pakistan.

 by Samuel A. Worthington

 The work that relief and humanitarian organizations carry out in Pakistan is far from easy or safe. We go to difficult areas

 and are targets for militants seeking to destroy our lifesaving mission through a campaign of killing, kidnapping and
 intimidation.

 Overtly branding our efforts as sponsored by the U.S. government — as the Obama administration wants us to do —

 only makes our jobs harder and more dangerous.

 I have the privilege of leading InterAction, an alliance of U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations conducting relief
 work around the world; nearly a quarter of our 200 members are responding to the recent floods in Pakistan, and many

 of them have been in Pakistan for decades.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772633 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

Though our efforts are supported by public donations, much of the assistance we deliver — whether food, water,

essential health care or education — comes via funding from the U.S. government. And in recent weeks, the Obama
administration has pressured us to make that link as clear and public as possible. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham

Clinton questioned our courage, suggesting last month that some NGOs are too "afraid to have association with the U.S.
government" while distributing aid in Pakistan.

None of the NGO workers in Pakistan — living under a daily threat of kidnappings or targeted killings — are cowards.

The dangers they face are immense, and their bravery must be commended as they help people whose lives have been
devastated by terrorism or the epic floods.

Of course, I understand where the administration is coming from. The U.S.-funded assistance we provide saves lives and

helps struggling communities rebuild. In the battle for hearts and minds in Pakistan, U.S. officials argue, the failure to
clearly advertise that the American government is behind this help — with, for instance, logos on medicines or signs on

food-distribution centers — is a missed opportunity. In 2009 the United States approved $7.5 billion in assistance to
Pakistan over the next five years; however, as Washington Post columnist David Ignatius noted recently, Pakistanis read

more about American drone attacks than about these aid dollars.

In countries such as Liberia or Democratic Republic of Congo, U.S. NGOs that get funding from the U.S. government
routinely promote the fact that they are delivering help "from the American people." But in Pakistan, where aid workers'

lives are more often at stake, an enforced branding campaign could undermine our ability to deliver assistance as fast as
possible without being a lightning rod for protests or attacks. It would also put the lives of Americans and their Pakistani

colleagues at risk. (It is usually Pakistani nationals who do the bulk of the work on the ground.)

In an environment where we are often soft targets for militants, drawing attention to our connection to the U.S.
government makes us even more vulnerable.

In March, one of InterAction's most active members in Pakistan, World Vision — which works on issues from health care

to farming to literacy — was attacked in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly called the North-West Frontier Province), and
seven of its employees were killed. And a year ago, the office of the World Food Program in Islamabad was attacked,

and five employees were killed.

There must be a balance among mitigating the risks NGOs face, communicating U.S. goodwill and delivering assistance
effectively. NGOs must be allowed to strike that balance on their own every day — even if the upshot is that we don't

include U.S. signs on new health clinics.

In some cases, particularly in less-volatile regions of Pakistan, conspicuously identifying aid as American may not pose a
threat to our work. But in areas where militants are particularly active, the risks to those delivering the aid may be great.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772633 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

These judgments must be made by the NGOs on the ground, depending on local circumstances, and not directed by the

State Department's branding concerns.

In Pakistani tribal areas along the Afghan border, for instance, the U.S. Agency for International Development has
granted our members waivers allowing us not to brand U.S. assistance, but there is growing pressure by the government

for these waivers to be phased out. While I agree that U.S. aid to the Pakistani people and government needs to be more
visible, this could put humanitarian workers' lives in jeopardy.

The American people are enormously generous, as shown after Haiti's devastating earthquake in January and in the

aftermath of the December 2004 tsunami in Asia. In Pakistan, the United States — through military and civilian

assistance, as well as through NGOs — is playing a major role in response to the recent floods, which forced at least 15
million people from their homes. The humanitarian groups I represent are providing basics, including clean water,
medicine and shelter.

The debate over branding our efforts is not simply another technical policy decision; for us, it can be a matter of life and
death. NGOs and the Obama administration must work together to find a solution that allows humanitarian workers in

the field flexibility to brand or not, according to security conditions on the ground.

We are ready and eager to have that dialogue. The lives of our front-line workers depend on it.

Samuel A. Worthington is president of InterAction, an alliance of U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations carrying out
international humanitarian and development work.

Statement by the Secretary

The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation

I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from

across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,

but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.

The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy

against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdarisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free
 people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around

the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.

The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in
 the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull together in solidarity to grieve this loss.

 My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.

January 18, 2011
Mitch McConnell Praises Obama For Progress In Afghanistan
By James R. Carroll

WASHINGTON — During an unannounced trip to Afghanistan, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell
praised the Obama administration Monday for its handling of the war and predicted "an overwhelming
likelihood of success" in the nearly decade-long conflict.

"I think we're doing it right. We're making substantial headway," the Kentucky Republican told reporters during
a call from Kabul, the Afghan capital, before flying back to Washington after a weekend trip with other Senate
Republicans.

He said the Taliban insurgency is facing increasing difficulties holding parts of the nation.

McConnell said he would define success as returning Afghanistan to conditions that existed there about 30

years ago, when the nation was exporting agricultural products and "they had a relatively normal life here."

"I think that's an achievable goal," McConnell said.

He said Allied forces are significantly degrading the insurgent Taliban's strength, he said. "They've had a very
bad year, and I expect they will have an even worse year in 2011," said McConnell, who was making his fourth
visit to Afghanistan.

But McConnell's view of America's prospects for success in Afghanistan is unjustifiably optimistic, said
Michael Desch, chairman of the political science department and co-director of the University of Notre Dame's
International Security Program.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776982 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

"I suppose you can go there and go on a dog-and-pony show and see some things that looked better than they
looked a year ago," said Desch, formerly director of the University of Kentucky's Patterson School of
Diplomacy and International Commerce.

Allied forces are killing more Taliban and forcing them out of some areas, but the insurgents are moving into

new areas of operations, Desch said.

Further, the key to winning against the Taliban is building an effective government and convincing Afghans to
buy into it, he said.

"The Karzai government remains deeply corrupt and deeply ineffective," Desch said. McConnell was part of a
group of GOP senators who made the trip to Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan over the weekend.

The others were Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Kelly Ayotte of
New Hampshire, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Marco Rubio of Florida and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.

The group met with the American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David Petraeus, as well as with Afghan
President Hamid Karzai.

In Pakistan, they talked with Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir and Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, chief of staff of
the Pakistan Army.

Desch said Pakistan's mounting problems are closely linked to what happens in Afghanistan.

The United States went to war in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Osama bin Laden, the
leader of al-Qaida, was sheltered in Afghanistan by the nation's Taliban government while planning the attacks.

When U.S. forces ousted the Taliban, bin Laden fled to Pakistan, and U.S. officials have said they don't know

his whereabouts today.

McConnell's visit follows last week's trip by Vice President Joe Biden, who made clear that the United States
would begin drawing down forces in July, depending on conditions, and handing over lead responsibility for
security to Afghan forces in 2014.

While Afghanistan will be charged with securing its own country, "we are not leaving, if you don't want us to
leave," Biden said in a joint appearance with Karzai on Jan. 11.

A December White House review of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, where there are about 97,000 American
troops, and Pakistan cited notable gains in the region, but cautioned that they "remain fragile and reversible."

"The challenge remains to make our gains durable and sustainable," the report said.
McConnell said, based on Biden's remarks, "there is no artificial timetable for withdrawal, and the Taliban
needs to understand that."

"It's clear that 2011 is a critical year for us here in Afghanistan," McConnell said. "It is the year in which

Afghanistan security forces are going to have to step up and play a bigger role."

McConnell and the other senators also met with American soldiers, including members of the 101st Airborne
based at Fort Campbell, Ky. He said morale among the troops was high.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776982 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

Rubio said he and the other senators "are heartened by the some of the early success that we've seen."

But after watching U.S., British and Jordanian troops conduct a training exercise with Afghan troops, Rubio

said much more needs to be accomplished. He noted that some trainees who will have to use a Humvee to
sweep for mines had never driven any vehicle before joining the military.

"They are certainly a world away from where they were," Rubio said. "There are real challenges. What we
learned is that for a significant period of time, there was no serious training effort. It will take time to ramp up."

The group toured a market in Nawa and Camp Leatherneck, a Marine Corps base, in southern Afghanistan. The
open-air market was evidence the local police force is doing better keeping the area secure, Rubio said.

McConnell said the country's southern region had been controlled by the Taliban, but thanks to the Marines the
area has "come back to life."

"There is some rudimentary evidence of commerce there — there (are) little shops springing back up," the
Kentuckian said. "There is no question the momentum of the Taliban in the south, which has been their
stronghold in Afghanistan for quite a while, has been completely reversed. Our military has performed just as
we knew they would, with valor and professionalism.

"Now the test in the future is whether the partnership with the Afghan government can bring about the security
that the country needs to kind of spring back to life," McConnell said.

HRC:

[Huma can you print for HRC]

Melanne is stepping through the QDDR and giving specific edits on each section to ensure the integration of gender.

In addition to that help, she shared her thoughts/concerns on the reorganization as it affects s/GWI. We already
determined from your earlier feedback that S/GWI would maintain a direct report to S (I actually always thought that

even with the reorganization of homes for many of the S offices, we still were maintaining a direct S/reporting so we are
revisiting this issue writ-large for the next draft to you. For example, we now know statutorily that S/CT legislatively is a

required S report).

That said, here is her narrative for your review for when we speak. I have embedded comments in caps in text after
each graph where relevant.

FROM:	            Melanne Verveer
DATE:	            November 4, 2010

RE:	               Gender Integration in the QDDR

        The Secretary has declared time and time again that the empowerment of women is "at the heart of the foreign

policy of the United States." Our collective task is torealize this principle by integrating gender into the policies and
programs of the State Department and USAID in an enduring way.

         We are concerned that the current draft of the QDDR falls short of this call. In the existing draft, the Office of

Global Women's Issues falls under a new Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights while
retaining the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues who reports directly to the Secretary. This new structure

misses the simple but important reality that women are half of the world's population and that the major security,
economic and social challenges of this century cannot be solved without them. These issues cut across the work of the

department and touch virtually all regions, though we place special emphasis on regions in which women and girls
are most vulnerable, such as in countries experiencing conflict and transition. Locating the office within one bureau

makes it impossible for the Office to implement its very charge — to integrate gender effectively into the work of the
entire State Department.

         Therefore, gender must be integrated throughout all of the regional and functional bureaus rather than located

within one bureau. Women should be integral to all of our diplomatic efforts—from traditional bilateral and multilateral
relationships, strategic dialogues, and public diplomacy, to our relations with civil society, community leaders and other

non-state actors. Women are also important to consider in all of our policy initiatives, including global health, food
security, climate change, economic issues, human rights, and peace and security. We must institute rigorous

institutional mechanisms to ensure that all bureaus, both regional and functional, consider gender in diplomacy and
development.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772152 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

        In order to integrate gender effectively throughout the work of the Department, we recommend the following

approach to planning, budgeting, structure and evaluation:

        Maintain visibility and focus on gender. Retain thembassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues who
reports to the Secretary. This position embodies our commitment to and advocacy for gender equality as an essential
part of diplomacy and development and signals our understanding that this is important to the national security of the

United States. In addition, the office advances a coherent and coordinated strategy on gender throughout the State
Department and USAID.    [DONE]

        Ensure that gender is effectively addressed throughout all bureaus and missions. We recommend the
following structural changes at State. First, make the Principal Deputy Assistant SecretaryS) in all regional and

functional bureaus responsible and accountable for their bureaus' work on gender. The Office of Global Women's Issues
would serve as a resource to the PDAS on these issues. Second, assign specialized gender liaisons to regionalaus
for purposes of integration, where needed. Third, include training and capacity development for employeesn gender

Issues (in both Foreignnd Civil Services well as for political appointees). Fourth, evaluate the PDAS in each bureau
gender integration in policies and programs (including, for example, as a component in the Performance Evaluation
System). Similarly, require each Chief of Mission to be responsible and accountable for the mission's work on gender, to

assign personnel with expertise to manage the work on gender, to require personnel to receive training on gender
issues, and to be evaluated on this work. A parallel structure should be put in place at USAID, and our diplomacy and
development work on gender should be coordinated and complimentary.

        Include gender in strategic planning and budget allocation.We recommend continuing the requirement
 initiated last year that all bureaus include a plan for gender integration in their annual Strategic Plan and Budget
 proposal. Each bureau is required to describe how their policies and programs will improve gender equality and how

 that will strengthen their work more generally. They are also required, to the extent possible, to outline what portion of
 their policies and programs target or affect women and girls. [THIS ALREADY IS IN PLACE AND WOULD BE RETAINED]

        Measure impact.   Develop indicators and long-term evaluation systems to measure the impact of programs on
 women and girls. There are efforts underway currently within F and at USAID to consider how to improve our

 measurement of impact on women and girls and to develop different and additional indicators where
 appropriate. [SAME AS IMMEDIATELYABOVE —THIS IS ALREADYINPROCESS]

Premier meets U.S. Vice President on sidelines of

Jewish GA, warns that sanctions have not been

enough against Iran.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. Vice President Joe Biden during their meeting in New
Orleans on Sunday that Israel had made enough efforts to reach a peace settlement with the Palestinians,
and has not received sufficient gestures in return.

Speaking to the vice president before the latter's address to the General Assembly of Jewish Federations,
Netanyahu said that a peace agreement could not be reached from above and added that the Palestinians
must be stopped from taking unilateral action at the United Nations in their quest to establish a state.

Netanyahu also told Biden that other Arab states must be brought into the peace process to give Israel
the political backing needed.

An Israeli political source said earlier Sunday that Netanyahu would tell Biden that the U.S. must create a
credible threat in the form of a military campaign to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

According to the official in Jerusalem, Netanyahu planned to stress that the West must operate with
suspicion and great caution in the face of Iran's recently stated intentions to renew dialogue over its
nuclear program.

The source also said that Netanyahu would warn Biden that the international community must be careful
not to fall into any sort of Iranian trap with regard to this expressed willingness, said the official.

The prime minister was expected to say that a credible threat of military action is the only way to ensure
that Iran will rethink its nuclear program, according to the Jerusalem official. Although Netanyahu believes
that the harsh military sanctions have weakened Iran, said the official, there is still no sign that they have
 led the Islamic Republic to consider halting its nuclear program.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772844 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

"The only way to ensure that Iran will not go nuclear is to create a credible threat of military action
against it if it doesn't cease its race for a nuclear weapon," the source said Netanyahu would tell Biden.

"The economic sanctions are making it difficult for Iran, but there is no sign that the Ayatollah regime
plans to stop its nuclear program because of them," the source said Netanyahu would add.

Netanyahu was also say that the only time Iran stopped its nuclear program was in 2003, when it believed
there was a threat of American military action, the source said, adding that the threat alone is enough to
prevent the need for military action.

Netanyahu arrived earlier Sunday in the U.S., where he was also set to meet Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton and address the General Assembly of Jewish Federations in New Orleans.

Asked about the comments, an Israeli official traveling with Netanyahu said the prime minister call in all
his meetings in the United States for pressure to be stepped up against Iran. He is also expected to
discuss with U.S. officials Israel's impasse in direct negotiations with the Palestinians.

"It is our fervent desire that the current impasse can be overcome and we see an expeditious return to
direct talks with the Palestinians," Netanyahu spokesman Mark Regev said on board the prime minister's
flight from Tel Aviv to New Orleans.

Netanyahu will meet Biden before the latter's own address to the GA. Netanyahu will deliver his speech to
the forum on Monday, before his four-day visit to New York.

During the trip, he will not see President Barack Obama, who is on a visit to Asia. But the U.S. visit will
give Netanyahu an opportunity to gauge the impact of last week's Republican rout of Obama's Democrats
in the midterm congressional elections.

Netanyahu was scheduled to hold talks in New York with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Monday
and Clinton on Thursday, before flying home.

TEHRAN—Agrowing confrontation between Iran's clerical rulers and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is spilling
over to unusually direct criticismof the president's inner circle of advisers.
Hard-lineayatollahs andrepresentatives of theRevolutionaryGuardCorps whowereinstrumental inbringing
Ahmadinejad to power in 2005 nowaccuse his top aides of plotting to push Shiite clerics frompolitics.

Although Ahmadinejad, who has become increasingly isolated, has relied closely on his tightknit group, the
critics are demandingthat the president cut all ties withhis team.
Inanapparentlyorchestratedeffort, official statemediahavestartedreportingthat somemembers of
Ahmadinejad's inner circle are relyingonfortune-tellers; others are chargedwithembezzlinggovernment
money. Official publications have begunreferring to Ahmadinejad's four topaides as leaders of a "deviant"

political current that is tryingtogainabsolutepowerinthecountry.
The power struggle took one of its apparent victims Tuesday when Iran's deputy foreign minister and ally of a
topAhmadinejadaide resigned. The AssociatedPress reportedthat MohammedSharif Malekzadehfaced
corruptioncharges, but has deniedthe allegations.

The moves against the advisers followa recent series of public clashes between the president and Iran's
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and signal a growing challenge to the president's grip on power.
Ahmadinejad's advisers represent "themost dangerous current inthehistoryof ShiiteIslam,"saidMojtaba
Zolnour, a leading cleric in the Revolutionary Guard forces, the semiofficial Mehr News Agency reported last

week. Another former supporter, hard-line ayatollahMohammadTaghi MesbahYazdi, recentlycalledthose
closetothepresident "garbage"and"trash."
There has often been competition among Iran's several power centers over the 32-year-old history of the
Islamicrepublic. But theblunt personal attacksonAhmadinejadandhisteamareextraordinary, andthereare
indications that thepressuremight bemounting. Last week, semiofficial mediainIranreportedthat aplanned

state visit by Ahmadinejad to neighboring Armenia was canceled when two of his advisers were not allowed to
leave the country.
Some Iranianpoliticians andanalysts saythat theybelieve the supreme leader has giventhe president afinal
chance to remove the aides, and that if Ahmadinejad does not do so, he could face impeachment.

Althougha decisionto remove the president couldbring instability andpolitical costs for Khamenei,
Ahmadinejad"couldbe removedif the leadershipwouldsee that fitting,"saidAmir Mohebbian, apolitical
analyst who inthe past supportedthe government but is nowcritical of its policies.
Analysts saythe attacks onthe advisers are aimedat further isolatingAhmadinejad, whowouldbe left more
weakenedandalone without his aides aroundhim.

Iran's judiciarysaidthis monththat at least adozenpeopleconnectedtothepresident hadbeenarrestedsince
April. The group did not include any of Ahmadinejad's closest advisers.
Workingfromthe presidential complexincentral Tehran, where oldsycamore trees line the avenues,
Ahmadinej ad's advisers have for years helped to draft the president's aggressive foreign and nuclear policies,

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05781329 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

advised him to make a daring cut in state subsidies and shaped his image as a hardworking man of the people.
Many members of his team met in the backward province where Ahmadinejad started his career as a deputy
governor in the 1980s, and stuck together as he became mayor of Tehran in 2003 and was the surprise winner of

the 2005 presidential elections.
After taking the helm of Iran's executive branch, they also called attention to a Shiite belief that the coming of
Imam Mahdi, an apocalyptic figure, is near. Mashaei, a 51-year-old former intelligence official who heads the
president's office, made a series of highly publicized remarks in the past few years advocating an unusual
interpretation of Shiite Islam that does not rely on clerics as intermediates between people and god.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad waves to the media as he arrives to a press conference, in Tehran,
Iran, Tuesday, June 7, 2011.
Ahmadinejad has called    Meshaei an "inspiration"; Meshaei's son married the president's daughter in 2008.
Persistent rumors that Mashaei claims to be in contact with the Messianic Imam, who according to Islamic
teachings went into hiding in the year 874, have recently made it to the front pages of state media, following the

arrest of several of his associates for "sorcery." Mashaei has never directly denied the accusations.
Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi, 52, a soft-spoken senior aide, acts as a shadow to Ahmadinejad, and is nearly
always at his side during public appearances. Samareh Hashemi went to university with Ahmadinejad and has
remained close to him since. Trained as an architect, he spent years at the foreign ministry deciding who would
be posted to Iranian missions around the world. He is one of the few close to the president who has not been
accused of wrongdoings.

Analysts say that old friends Mashaei and Samareh Hashemi both help boost Ahmadinejad's self-confidence.
Mohebbian said Ahmadinejad could try to groom one of these two men as his successor, in order to        remain
influential after his term ends in 2013. "If Ahmadinejad is looking for people to continue his policies, these two
men would be main candidates," he said.
Among a wider circle of other aides, the most controversial is Hamid Baghaei, 42, who for decades has worked
as a mid-level government official. Baghaei is closely connected to Mashaei and has taken up a post he used to

hold at Iran's cultural heritage organization, which is officially part of the government.
Baghaei was banned from holding public office following what Iran's judiciary has called "repeated offences,"
though his illegal acts were not detailed. He has appealed the ruling and, as he awaits retrial, is allowed to
remain in his post.
Iranian media has connected him to land grabbing on the Persian Gulf holiday island of Kish. After pictures of

him posing with the American flag and the Statue of Liberty were posted online, he was also accused of trying
to improve relations with the United States.
Although Iran's supreme leader often stresses that it is essential for the Islamic Republic's survival to resist the
United States on all fronts, many suspect that the president's team is politically interested in creating better
relations with the U.S. in order to boost domestic popularity. The government has denied this.
Another aide, first vice president Mohammad Reza Rahimi, 62, is relatively new to Ahmadinejad's inner circle.

In 2005 the former regional governor campaigned for Ahmadinejad's main opponent, ex-president Ali Akbar
Hashemi-Rafsanjani.
But Rahimi decided to side with the winner and recently said that Ahmadinejad could be a new "prophet." An
influential parliamentarian said Tuesday that the judiciary is preparing to bring charges against Rahimi for his
role in the embezzlement of more than $1 billion, an allegation Rahimi denies.
Many former supporters of the government are now among its staunchest critics. "When he became a candidate

in 2005, Ahmadinejad had surrounded himself with good people," said Reza Golpour, a Shiite activist and
writer who at that time was a strong backer of the president. Since, then, he said a creeping takeover by Mashaei
and his "agents" had occurred.

Yes, Ma'am. International space cooperation (which is an overall positive point in U.S. foreign policy efforts), new non-
traditional space partnerships in furtherance of the Administration's policies, and China-related issues, are probably the

chief items.

Thanks again.

Hi, Cheryl! I appreciate Lona's reply, and wonder if you could ask her to get back to me next week with
suggestions for dates/times in December that might be good for a 30-minute meeting between Secretary Clinton

and the NASA Administrator? Thanks, as always.

 Thanks, Lona. No worries. I hope you will all get some much-needed rest from your most

 recent travels, too!

  We were thinking sometime in Deceniber for a quick meeting. Can we consider that, please?

 Thanks again.

         Good morning, Lona. I hope that this note finds you well.

         As you can see from the exchange below, the NASA Administrator, Gen. Bolden,
         will be the Guest of Honor for the Department of State's Marine Corps Birthday
         Celebration on November 3, 2011. I am wondering whether this might provide
         an opportunity for a brief meeting with the Secretary on that date, perhaps on the

         margins of the event at the State Department. If not, I would be grateful to
          receive your suggested dates on which the Secretary may be available between
          October and early 2012.

          Thank you, as always, for your assistance.

    American Diplomacy Revealed — as Good

    By ROGER COHEN

    NEW YORK — Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!

    They are, to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their

private or secret cables, thoughtful, well-informed and dedicated servants of

the American interest who write clear, declarative English sentences.

    I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable

career diplomats whose diplomacy is now condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they

whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if their

correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they would lose most

of their sources. That should give every journalist pause.

     So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will

self-censor. They will go quiet, particularly in the more conspiratorial parts

of the world which also tend to be the most unstable, like the Middle East.

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777389 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

Layers of secrecy will be added.

    Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S.

interests across a broad but probably shallow spectrum. That will satisfy him in

that he's a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.

    Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond

the "shock" of venal Gulf Arab Sunni leaders looking for war on the cheap

against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or

the "shock" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the

"shock" of yet more premature Israeli predictions on when Iran will have a

nuclear weapon; or the "shock" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the

"shock" of the Chinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the "shock" of Muammar

el-Qaddafi's taste for voluptuous Slavic women and Silvio Beriusconi's taste for

all women — perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and

short on embarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with

the world as we already knew it, right down to the familiar adjectives evoking

 French President Nicolas Sarkozy: "hyperactive," "mercurial," "authoritarian,"

"erratic," "monarch-like."

     I swear, if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department

 people could have become good hacks.

     Overall, my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats

 has been redoubled, not least for this underreported nugget on the turbulent

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777389 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

Iranian election of 2009, contained in a cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai:

"While we don't know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count, it is

clear that the turnout was at record high levels and that there was systematic

vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that

Ahmadinejad 'won big' in the first round."

     It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American

diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in Tehran during the election and its

violent aftermath.

     A couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of

the Gulf are as exercised as they are about Tehran in part because they know

that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the

 United States. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic

equation is strong; nothing would redraw the Middle East more than overcoming

the U.S.-Iranian psychosis.

     The second is that President Barack Obama's approach to Iran has been much

 more conventional than his initial outreach suggested_ Old habits of attempted

 coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross's tired

 thinking about balancing "appetizing carrots" with "sharp sticks" in tackling

 Iran's nuclear program.

     The cables reveal that as early as March 2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was

 talking "dual track," telling Europeans that "engagement alone is unlikely to

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777389 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

succeed" and calling for added "pressure." Perhaps Iranian skepticism could

never have been overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding

Iranian grievances would fester.

    Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or

diplomacy. In an interview with Time, he expressed approval for Israeli Prime

Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "coming out with a very interesting statement that

leaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can" and

bought into Netanyahu's view that this, in Assange's words, would "lead to some

kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in

relation to Iran."

    Huh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls

for a U.S.-led war against Iran, an option he also favors. And that, for

Assange, is a step forward to peace! He's all over the place.

     What should we make of this brainy naïf who told my colleague John Burns

that America is a threat to democracy? He's a loose canon; let him be. My

impression is he's self-armed with a spade and he's digging.

     And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing, offering

plenty of voyeuristic titillation but no gasp of discovery. They provide texture

but break little new ground. Yet their publication has done significant damage

to the courageous work of America's diplomats and may endanger lives. That's a

 tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive.

ways, but she is forcing the issue in important ways. Great plane reading — hope also you read what I sent you on Syria.

Why Do They Hate Us?

The real war on women is in the M iddle East.

BY MONA ELTAHAWYIMAY/JUNE      2012

 In"Distant View of a Minaret,"      the late and much-neglected Egyptian writer Alifa Rifaat begins her short story

with a woman so unmoved by sex with her husband that as he focuses solely on his pleasure, she notices a spider

web she must sweep off the ceiling and has time to ruminate on her husband's repeated refusal to prolong

 intercourse until she too climaxes, "as though purposely to deprive her." Just as her husband denies her an orgasm,

 the call to prayer interrupts his, and the man leaves. After washing up, she loses herself in prayer -- so much more

                                    the next prayer -- and looks out onto the street from her balcony. She interrupts
 satisfying that she can't waitntil

 her reverie to make coffee dutifully for her husband to drink after his nap. Taking it to their bedroom to pour it in

 front of him as he prefers, she notices he is dead. She instructs their son to go and get a doctor. "She returned to the

 living room and poured out the coffee for herself. She was surprised at how calm she was," Rifaat  writes.

       AMore...

 In a crisp three-and-a-half pages, Rifaat lays out a trifecta of sex, death, and religion, a bulldozer that crushes denial

 and defensiveness to get at the pulsating heart of misogyny in the Middle East. There is no sugarcoating it. They

 don't hate us because of our freedoms, as the tired, post-9/ii American cliche had it. We have no freedoms because

 they hate us, as this Arab woman so powerfully says.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05789601 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

Yes: They hate us. It must be said.

Some may ask why I'm bringing this up now, at a time when the region has risen up, fueled not by the usual hatred

of America and Israel but by a common demand for freedom. After all, shouldn't everyone get basic rights first,

before women demand special treatment? And what does gender, or for that matter, sex, have to do with the Arab

Spring? But I'm not talking about sex hidden away in dark corners and closed bedrooms. An entire political and

economic system -- one that treats half of humanity like animals -- must be destroyed along with the other more

obvious tyrannies choking off the region from its future. Until the rage shifts from the oppressors in our presidential

palaces to the oppressors on our streets and in our homes, our revolution has not even begun.

                                  in the Egyptian
                                  criminal code
                            says that if a woman has
                            with good intentions" nond
                            punitive damages can be
                            obtained.

So: Yes, women all over the world have problems; yes, the United States has yet to elect a female president; and yes,

women continue to be objectified in many "Western" countries (I live in one of them). That's where the conversation

usually ends when you try to discuss why Arab societies hate women.

                                                           DON'TMISS

                                                  The Worst Places to Be a Woman

But let's put aside what the United States does or doesn't do to women. Name me an Arab country, and I'll recite a

litany of abuses fueled by a toxic mix of culture and religion that few seem willing or able to disentangle lest they

blaspheme or offend. When more than 90 percent of ever-married women in Egypt -- including my mother and all

but one of her six sisters -- have had their genitals cut in the name of modesty, then surely we must all blaspheme.

When Egyptian women are subjected to humiliating "virginity tests" merely for speaking out, it's no time for silence.

When an article in the Egyptian criminal code says that if a woman has been beaten by her husband "with good

intentions" no punitive damages can be obtained, then to hell with political correctness. And what, pray tell, are

"good intentions"? They are legally deemed to include any beating that is "not severe" or "directed at the face." What

all this means is that when it comes to the status of women in the Middle East, it's not better than you think. It's

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05789601 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

much, much worse. Even after these "revolutions," all is more or less considered well with the world as long as

women are covered up, anchored to the home, denied the simple mobility of getting into their own cars, forced to get
permission from men to travel, and unable to marry without a male guardian's blessing -- or divorce either.

Not a single Arab country ranks in the top 100 in the World Economic Forum's   Global Gender Gap Report,

putting the region as a whole solidly at the planet's rock bottom. Poor or rich, we all hate our women. Neighbors

Saudi Arabia and Yemen, for instance, might be eons apart when it comes to GDP, but only four places separate

them on the index, with the kingdom at 131 and Yemen coming in at 135 out of 135 countries. Morocco, often touted
for its "progressive" family law (a 2005 report by Western "experts"called it "an example for Muslim countries

aiming to integrate into modern society"), ranks 129; according to Morocco's Ministry of Justice, 41,098 girls under

age 18 were married there in 2010.

It's easy to see why the lowest-ranked country is Yemen, where 55 percent of women are illiterate, 79 percent do not

participate in the labor force, and just one woman serves in the 301-person parliament. Horrific news reports about

12-year-old girls dying in childbirth     do little to stem the tide of child marriage there. Instead, demonstrations

in support of child marriage outstrip those against it, fueled by clerical declarations that opponents of state-

sanctioned pedophilia are apostates because the Prophet Mohammed, according to them, married his second wife,

Aisha, when she was a child.
    at least Yemeni women can drive. It surely hasn't ended their litany of problems, but it symbolizes freedom --
But
and nowhere does such symbolism resonate more than in Saudi Arabia, where child marriage is also practiced and

women are perpetually minors regardless of their age or education. Saudi women far outnumber their male

counterparts on university campuses but are reduced to watching men far less qualified control every aspect of their

lives.

                                                   DON'TMISS

                                             Debating the War on Women

 Yes, Saudi Arabia, the country where a gang-rape survivor was sentenced to jail for agreeing to get into a car with an

 unrelated male and needed a royal pardon; Saudi Arabia, where a woman who broke the ban on driving was

 sentenced to 10 lashes and again needed a royal pardon; Saudi Arabia, where women still can't vote or run in

 elections, yet it's considered "progress" that a royal decree promised to enfranchise them for almost completely

 symbolic local elections in -- wait for it -- 2015. So bad is it for women in Saudi Arabia that those tiny paternalistic

 pats on their backs are greeted with delight as the monarch behind them, King Abdullah, is hailed as a "reformer" --

 even by those who ought to know better, such as Newsweek,     which in 2010 named the king one of the top 11 most

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05789601 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

respected world leaders. You want to know how bad it is? The "reformer's" answer to the revolutions popping up

across the region was to numb his people with still more government handouts -- especially for the Salafi zealots

from whom the Saudi royal family inhales legitimacy. King Abdullah is 87. Just wait until you see the next in line,

Prince Nayef, a man straight out of the Middle Ages. His misogyny and zealotry make King Abdullah look like Susan

B. Anthon

                                 When more than
                                 90 percent of
                           women in Egypt-including
                           my mother and all but one
                           of her six sisters-
                                  then surely we
                           must all blaspheme.

SO WHY DO THEY HATE US?                Sex, or more precisely hymens, explains much.

"Why extremists always focus on women remains a mystery to me," U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton             said

recently.   "But they all seem to. It doesn't matter what country they're in or what religion they claim. They want to

control women." (And yet Clinton represents an administration that openly supports many of those misogynistic

despots.) Attempts to control by such regimes often stem from the suspicion that without it, a woman is just a few

 degrees short of sexual insatiability. Observe Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the popular cleric and longtime conservative         TV

 host on Al Jazeera who developed a stunning penchant for the Arab Spring revolutions -- once they were under way,

 that is -- undoubtedly understanding that they would eliminate the tyrants who long tormented and oppressed both

 him and the Muslim Brotherhood movement from which he springs.

 I could find you a host of crackpots sounding off on Woman the Insatiable Temptress, but I'm staying mainstream

 with Qaradawi, who commands a huge audience on and off the satellite channels. Although he says female genital

 mutilation (which he calls "circumcision," a common euphemism that tries to put the practice on a par with male

 circumcision) is not "obligatory," you will also find this priceless observation in one of his books: "I personally

 support this under the current circumstances in the modern world. Anyone who thinks that circumcision is the best

 way to protect his daughters should do it," he wrote, adding, "The moderate opinion is in favor of practicing

 circumcision to reduce temptation." So even among "moderates," girls' genitals are cut to ensure their desire is

 nipped in the bud -- pun fully intended. Qaradawi has since issued a fatwa against female genital mutilation, but it

 comes as no surprise that when Egypt banned the practice in 2008, some Muslim Brotherhood legislators opposed

 the law. And some still do -- including a prominent female parliamentarian, Azza al-Garf.

 Yet it's the men who can't control themselves on the streets, where from Morocco to Yemen, sexual harassment is

 endemic and it's for the men's sake that so many women are encouraged to cover up. Cairo has a women-only

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05789601 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

subway car to protect us from wandering hands and worse; countless Saudi malls are for families only, barring single

men from entry unless they produce a requisite female to accompany them.

                               When Egyptian
                               subjected to
                         humiliating ''virginity tests"
                         merely for speaking out,

We often hear how the Middle East's failing economies have left many men unable to marry, and some even use that

to explain rising levels of sexual harassment on the streets. In a2008  survey by the  Egyptian Center for

Women's Rights,      more than   8o percent of Egyptian women said they'd experienced sexual harassment and more

than  6o percent of men admitted to harassing women. Yet we never hear how a later marriage age affects women.

Do women have sex drives or not? Apparently, the Arab jury is still out on the basics of human biology.

Enter that call to prayer and the sublimation through religion that Rifaat so brilliantly introduces in her story. Just

as regime-appointed clerics lull the poor across the region with promises of justice -- and nubile virgins -- in the next

world rather than a reckoning with the corruption and nepotism of the dictator in this life, so women are silenced by

a deadly combination of men who hate them while also claiming to have God firmly on their side.

 I turn again to Saudi Arabia, and not just because when I encountered the country at age 15 I was traumatized into

 feminism -- there's no other way to describe it -- but because the kingdom is unabashed in its worship of a

 misogynistic God and never suffers any consequences for it, thanks to its double-whammy advantage of having oil

 and being home to Islam's two holiest places, Mecca and Medina.

 Then -- the 198os and 1990s -- as now, clerics on Saudi TV were obsessed with women and their orifices, especially

 what came out of them. I'll never forget hearing that if a baby boy urinated on you, you could go ahead and pray in

 the same clothes, yet if a baby girl peed on you, you had to change. What on Earth in the girl's urine made you

 impure? I wondered.

 Hatred of women.

 How much does Saudi Arabia hate women? So much so that         15 girls died  in a school fire in Mecca in2002,  after

 "morality police" barred them from fleeing the burning building -- and kept firefighters from rescuing them --

 because the girls were not wearing headscarves and cloaks required in public. And nothing happened. No one was

 put on trial. Parents were silenced. The only concession to the horror was that girls' education was quietly taken

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05789601 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

away by then-Crown Prince Abdullah from the Salafi zealots, who have nonetheless managed to retain their vise-like

 ri on the ldn dom's education system writ large.

This, however, is no mere Saudi phenomenon, no hateful curiosity in the rich, isolated desert. The Islamist hatred of

women burns brightly across the region -- now more than ever.

In Kuwait, where for years Islamists fought women's enfranchisement, they hounded the four women who finally

made it into parliament, demanding that the two who didn't cover their hair wear hijabs. When the Kuwaiti

parliament was dissolved this past December, an Islamist parliamentarian demanded the new house -- devoid of a

single female legislator -- discuss his proposed "decent attire" law.

In Tunisia, long considered the closest thing to a beacon of tolerance in the region, women took a deep breath last

fall after the Islamist Ennanda party won the largest share of votes in the country's Constituent Assembly. Party
leaders vowed to respect Tunisia's 1956 Personal Status Code, which declared "the principle of equality between men

and women" as citizens and banned polygamy. But female university professors and students have complained since

then of assaults and intimidation by Islamists for not wearing hijabs, while many women's rights activists wonder

 how talk of Islamic law will affect the actual law they will live under in post-revolution Tunisia.

 In Libya, the first thing the head of the interim government, Mustafa Abdel Jalil, promised to do was to lift the late

 Libyan tyrant's restrictions on polygamy. Lest you think of Muammar al-Qaddafi as a feminist of any kind,

 remember that under his rule girls and women who survived sexual assaults or were suspected of "moral crimes"

 were dumped into "social rehabilitation centers," effective prisons from which they could not leave unless a man

 agreed to marry them or their families took them back.

 Then there's Egypt, where less than a month after President Hosni Mubarak stepped down, the military junta that

 replaced him, ostensibly to "protect the revolution," inadvertently reminded us of the two revolutions we women

 need. After it cleared Tahrir Square of protesters, the military detained dozens of male and female activists. Tyrants

 oppress, beat, and torture all. We know. But these officers reserved "virginity tests" for female activists: rape
 disguised as a medical doctor inserting his fingers into their vaginal opening in search of hymens. (The doctor was

 sued and eventually  acquitted   in March.)

 What hope can there be for women in the new Egyptian parliament, dominated as it is by men stuck in the seventh

 century? A quarter of those parliamentary seats are now held by Salafis, who believe that mimicking the original

 ways of the Prophet Mohammed is an appropriate prescription for modern life. Last fall, when fielding female

 candidates, Egypt's Salafi Nour Party ran a flower in place of each woman's face. Women are not to be seen or heard

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05789601 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

--even their voices are a temptation -- so there they are in the Egyptian parliament, covered from head to toe in

black and never uttering a word.

And we're in the middle of a revolution in Egypt! It's a revolution in which women have died, been beaten, shot at,

and sexually assaulted fighting alongside men to rid our country of that uppercase Patriarch -- Mubarak -- yet so

many lowercase patriarchs still oppress us. The Muslim Brotherhood, with almost half the total seats in our new

revolutionary parliament, does not believe women (or Christians for that matter) can be president. The woman who

heads the "women's committee" of the Brotherhood's political party said recently that women should not march or

protest because it's more "dignified" to let their husbands and brothers demonstrate for them.

      0 0

                          Yes: Theyhateus.
                          it mustbe said."

The hatred of women goes deep in Egyptian society. Those of us who have marched and protested have had to

navigate a minefield of sexual assaults by both the regime and its lackeys, and, sadly, at times by our fellow

revolutionaries. On the November day I was sexually assaulted on Mohamed Mahmoud Street near Tahrir Square,

by at least four Egyptian riot police, I was first groped by a man in the square itself. While we are eager to expose

assaults by the regime, when we're violated by our fellow civilians we immediately assume they're agents of the

 regime or thugs because we don't want to taint the revolution.

SO WHAT IS TO BE DONE?

 First we stop pretending. Call out the hate for what it is. Resist cultural relativism and know that even in countries

 undergoing revolutions and uprisings, women will remain the cheapest bargaining chips. You -- the outside world --

 will be told that it's our "culture" and "religion" to do X, Y, or Z to women. Understand that whoever deemed it as
 such was never a woman. The Arab uprisings may have been sparked by an Arab man -- Mohamed Bouazizi, the

 Tunisian street vendor who set himself on fire in desperation -- but they will be finished by Arab women.

 Amina Filali --the 16-year-old Moroccan girl who drank poison after she was    forced to marry,    and beaten by, her

 rapist -- is ourouazizi. Salwa el-Husseini, the first Egyptian woman to speak out against the   "virginity tests";

 Samira Ibrahim,     the first oneto sue;  and Rasha Abdel Rahman, who testified alongside her -- they are our

 Bouazizis. We must not wait for them to die to become so. Manal al-Sharif, who spent nine days in jail for breaking

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05789601 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

her country's ban on women driving,    is Saudi Arabia's Bouazizi. She is a one-woman revolutionary force who
pushes against an ocean of misogyny.

                                                  DON'TMISS

                                                   The Sex Issue

Our political revolutions willot succeed unless they are accompanied by revolutions of thought -- social, sexual,
and cultural revolutions that topple the Mubaraks in our minds as well as our bedrooms.

"Do you know why they subjected us to virginity tests?" Ibrahim asked me soon after we'd spent hours marching

together to mark International Women's Day in Cairo on March 8. "They want to silence us; they want to chase

women back home. But we're not going anywhere."

We are more than our headscarves and our hymens. Listen to those of us fighting. Amplify the voices of the region

and poke the hatred in its eye. There was a time when being an Islamist was the most vulnerable political position in
Egypt and Tunisia. Understand that now it very well might be Woman. As it always has been.

See below - my goodbye. To be posted Thurs on Hill, HuffPo, Daily Caller, and Foxnews.com.

After written and submitted, had to write a last minute insertion when Accountability Board report came out Tues night.

I hope you enjoy the memories - especially mom remembering your sparkling yellow pants suit!

I sent you my best wishes thru cdm when I heard about your fall. Happened to me once - faint and hard knock on marble
floor. Scary.

But your great husband and my great wife agree we are well protected - hard-headed.

Take care of yourself - and look forward to a long rest as I wrote at the end.

Best,

Lanny

(Josh is now a sprouting twig, taller than dad - and who, like grand-ma Fran, considers Hillary a hero. Hope we can come

by for a minute for photo and a quick good-bye).

 "Farewell to Secretary Clinton - Public Servant and Friend"

 By Lanny J. Davis

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05797201 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

The fact that she may be the most popular Secretary of State in U.S. history is no surprise. All the qualities that

made her so successful are familiar to those of us who have known her for a long time: always working hard,
sensitive to others, smart, seeing the big picture, great people skills.

Memories...

September 1969. I first met Hillary Rodham when I was a third-year student at Yale Law School, registering for

classes, and she was behind me in line. I recognized her, since I had recently seen her photo in a national
magazine story about her Valedtorian Speech at Wellesley College about the legacy of the 1960s. Within five

minutes she had asked me where the nearest legal clinic for the poor was in New Haven. Five minutes later I
had made up my mind. One day she would be the first female president of the United States or at least United

States Senator. Almost everyone who knew her back then had the same first reaction.

Fast forward to October 1997: My mom, frail from growing indications of heart failure, visited me at the
White House so I could introduce her to her hero, Hillary. I had her. repeat after me as we walked to the

residence: "Hello Mrs. Clinton, nice to meet you Mrs. Clinton, good-bye Mrs. Clinton" - nothing more. When
the First Lady walked into the room wearing a bright yellow pantsuit, she said, "Hello Mrs. Clinton." But then

she said: "Didn't you wear that suit on Larry King's show last week?" I gasped. Mom put her hand over her
mouth and looked at me, anxiously, knowing she had gone off-script.

Hillary burst out laughing — that wonderful Hillary belly-laugh that has made all her friends laugh with her
through the years without actually knowing what they were laughing at. "Yes, Fran, I did. You are very

observant!" Mom joined her in laughter—visibly relieved.

January 2003: Newly elected South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, formerly the key
Republican floor manager on impeachment, whom I had come to know during our many TV debates on the

impeachment issue, called me to ask me whether he should approach Senator Clinton to try to work together.
Of course, I said.

Months later, I was not surprised that Senator Graham and Senator Clinton had worked together on the

Senate Armed Services Committee to sponsor expanded health care benefits for National Guard and Reserve
members. Nor was I surprised when the late Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia praised her as a "work
horse, not a show horse."

Jan 2009— 2012: As Secretary of State, she traveled to 112 countries and transformed the way America

conducts diplomacy and development — with historic focus on linking women's rights around the world to U.S.
national security interests. She took full responsibility for the failures in the State Department that led to the

tragic death of the U.S. Ambassador and three other Americans. The Accountability Review Board on Tuesday
night completed its investigation, found systematic management failures at the department, and made 29

recommendations to improve embassy security. Secretary Clinton accepted them all. In my view, that terrible
tragedy does not mar her outstanding performance as Secretary.

When Hillary Rodham Clinton leaves office some time in the near future, it will be time for her to rest. Watch

the real estate/home development show, "Love It or List It" on HMV, whenever she wants to — no scheduler
to tell her what to do. She will have time to think; enjoy, love and support her husband and family, as she

always has done as her first priority in her life; for awhile, I hope, do nothing but relax.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05797201 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

But that won't last. I don't know whether she will ever run for public office again. But I do know one thing.

She will resume an active life doing the public good, doing public service, impacting the world around her to
teach and help others less fortunate than she, somehow, somewhere.

For that is who she is. And that is who she always will be.

2010/1811

Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke passed away this evening, surrounded by his wife, Kati, his sons David and
Anthony, his step-children Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and the rest of their
family.

Secretary Clinton released the following statement on his passing:

                                 STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

                                         Passing of Richard Holbrooke

Tonight America has lost one of its fiercest champions and most dedicated public servants. Richard Holbrooke
served the country he loved for nearly half a century, representing the United States in far-flung war-zones and

high-level peace talks, always with distinctive brilliance and unmatched determination. He was one of a kind --
a true statesman -- and that makes his passing all the more painful.

From his early days in Vietnam to his historic role bringing peace to the Balkans to his last mission in

Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard helped shape our history, manage our perilous present, and secure our future.
He was the consummate diplomat, able to stare down dictators and stand up for America's interests and values
even under the most difficult circumstances. He served at every level of the Foreign Service and beyond,
helping mentor generations of talented officers and future ambassadors. Few people have ever left a larger mark
on the State Department or our country. From Southeast Asia to post-Cold War Europe and around the globe,

people have a better chance of a peaceful future because of Richard's lifetime of service.

I had the privilege to know Richard for many years and to call him a friend, colleague and confidante. As
Secretary of State, I have counted on his advice and relied on his leadership. This is a sad day for me, for the

State Department and for the United States of America.

True to form, Richard was a fighter to the end. His doctors marveled at his strength and his willpower, but to his
friends, that was just Richard being Richard. I am grateful for the tireless efforts of all the medical staff, and to
everyone who sat by his side or wished him well in these final days.

Tonight my thoughts and prayers are with Richard's beloved wife Kati, his sons David and Anthony, his step-
children Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and all of his countless friends and
colleagues.

BETHLEHEM (Reuters) -        A Palestinian Authority draft resolution condemning Israel's West Bank settlement
activity is ready to be presented to the UNSC, a senior Palestinian Authority official said. Saeb Erekat, the chief

Palestinian Authority negotiator in peace talks with Israel, said he expected the resolution would be put to a
UNSC vote in February, after the United States ends its presidency of the council. "We are not condemning
Israel. We are condemning settlement activities and we hope the resolution will pass," Erekat said. He said 15

nations had helped draft the proposal after Palestinian Authority President Abbas requested a UNSC meeting to
discuss settlement building in November. "Something must be done on the international level to halt the
settlement expansion which the Israeli government is undertaking in the West Bank, including Jerusalem,"

Nabil Abu Rdainah, Abbas's spokesman, said at the time. As the Palestinian Authority has only observer status
at the UN, the resolution will be presented by a full member of the council. Erekat said he hoped the United
States would not use its veto to defeat the resolution and added that if it did not succeed at the UNSC, "we will
go to the International Court of Justice."

         SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as
         well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and
         security services.

                1. During the afternoon of September 11,       2012  new interim President of Libya
         Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf spoke in private with senior advisors, including the
         members of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, to discuss the attacks by demonstrators

         on U.S. missions in Tripoli and Benghazi. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
         was shaken by the attacks, and gave permission to commanders on the ground for
         security forces to open fire over the heads of the crowds in an effort to break up mobs

         attacking the missions. During this session, a senior security officer told el Magariaf
         that the attacks on that day were inspired by what many devout Libyan viewed as a

         sacrilegious internet video on the prophet Mohammed originating in America. The
         Libyan attacks were also inspired by and linked to an attack on the U.S. mission in
         Egypt on the same day. At the same time, el Magariaf noted in strong terms that the

         atmosphere that made fostered these incidents in Libya is the product of widespread
         publicity regarding the security situation in the country between         2004  and  2010   and

          the cooperation that developed between a number of Western Intelligence services and
          the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.

                2.  This source added that el Magariafs advisors believe that this situation adds

          to the President's growing concern over the unpredictable effects that will follow
          current covert efforts by his political opponents to link him directly to foreign
          intelligence services. According to a separate sensitive source, el Magariaf noted that
          his opponents had often tried to connect him to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency

          (CIA) through the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), a group
          established in opposition to former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, which el Magariaf
          led in the 198os. In the opinion of this individual el Magariaf believes that he can
         survive potential negative publicity in this regard, but if this situation continues to
          develop in this manner it will complicate his efforts to establish an orderly

         administration in the country. Again, he stated that the attacks on the U.S. missions
         were as much a result of the atmosphere created by this campaign, as the controversial
          internet video.

                    At the same time, this .individual noted that several of el Magariaf s advisors
                3.
         share his concerns in this matter, pointing out that the return of Qaddafi's intelligence
         chief Abdullah al-Senoussi for trial in Libya has heightened public interest in the
         liaison relationships conducted by the CIA and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)
         with Qaddfis intelligence and security services. These same individuals note that they

         believe Islamist militia forces under the command of General Abdeihaldm Belhaj
         captured files and documents describing this relationship from Qaddafi's offices in
         Tripoli. This fascination with Western intelligence operations in Qaddafi's Libya is also
         driven by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and its efforts to tie Western governments to
         human rights violations committed under Qaddafi. In this regard HRW has

         interviewed at least fourteen (14) individuals claiming that they were.turned over to
         Qaddafi's forces by the Western powers. Belhaj is included in this group.

                4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el Magariaf s

         enemies are .working to take advantage of his suspected links to the CIA at a time when
         Western intelligence services are under scrutiny in Libya. They also fear that this
         situation will only grow more complex as Qaddafi's son Saif al Islam Qaddafi and al
         Senousi are brought before Libyan courts to answer for their crimes under the old
         regime, particularly during the 2011 revolution. These individuals believe both men

         will be linked to Western Intelligence during their trials. )

                5. According to this individual, el Magariaf is working with the Muslim
         Brotherhood and other Islamist groups to defuse this situation. He is particularly

         concerned by the level of violence between Sufi Muslims and Salafists, and believes he
         must maintain his reputation for impartiality if he is to defuse this growing problem.
         As he works to organize the government, and disarm the militias, he cannot afford to
         lose the respect and trust of the Libyan people, especially at a time when cultural

           have taken central stage in the new Libya. This source adds that these religious
           conflicts were largely unknown during Qaddafi's rule.
                  6. (Source Comment: This source added that the individuals interviewed for the

           HRW report were former members of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group (LIFG), an
           Islamist group formed in opposition to Gaddafi's controversial interpretations of Islam.
           These LIFG fighters fled the country in the late 1980s and went to Afghanistan to join

           the fight against the Soviet Union while also gaining training and experience for their
           own struggle. A separate source adds that messages to Libya from the CIA and SIS
           were found among the Tripoli Documents published by HRW, indicating that the

           United States and Britain were eager to help Libya capture several senior LIFG figures,
           including its co-founders, Belhaj and Sarni al-Saadi.)

                  7. As Libyan authorities struggle to control the armed rings that refuse to
           surrender weapons following last year's civil war, Salafis, who say Islam should return
           to the simple ways followed by Mohammed, have established their own armed gangs in

           post-Gaddafi Libya. They view Sufi practices as idolatrous. Since the start of the Arab
           Spring uprising across the region, a number of Sufi sites have been attacked in Egypt,
           Mali and Libya. Magariaf is determined to establish a democratic state based on

           Islamic principles. This individual adds that Magariaf remains dedicated to the idea of
           building a tolerant Islamic state in Libya. El Magariafs opinions continue to be shaped
           by his experience with Qaddafi, whom he felt built a cult of personality in violation of

           all of the basic ideas of Islam.

P proposing you put out the below based on bombing in Iran today. Thoughts?

For Immediate Release September 22, 2010

STATEMENTBYSECRETARYCLINTON

Explosion in Mahabad, Iran

I condemn the bombing targeting Iranians attending a parade in Mahabad today. The United States deplores this

senseless loss of life and extends its sympathy to the families and loved ones of those injured and killed. We also call for
the perpetrators of this horrific attack to be held accountable for their actions.

The United States condemns terrorism and all forms violence against innocent people, wherever it occurs, and stands
with the victims of these appalling acts. This attack underscores the global community's need to work together to
combat terrorist organizations that threaten the lives of innocent civilians all around the world.

Dear Burns:

 It has been some time since we spoke so I wanted to start by wishing you a happy new year and thanking you for your
assistance in placing our corporate contribution for Haiti Relief through the Clinton Foundation.

My hope is that you can further help me with two very different requests related to the Haitian tragedy:

1.	           After the tsunami devastated parts of Indonesia in 2004, I felt strongly that the CEOs of American

 corporations involved in the planning, construction and operation of civil, energy, water and telecommunication
 infrastructure should lead a charitable effort involving human as well as financial resources to develop an

 implementation plan for the rebuilding of the country once the Red Cross, the Military and the other "first responders"
 had stabilized the situation. I think the concept is even more relevant in 2010 with respect to Haiti which obviously is

 much closer to the United States and has much less indigenous skills and resources of its own to apply to the rebuilding
 effort. Given President Clinton's normal powers of persuasion and his passion for improving Haiti even before the

 earthquake (it was the only thing he wanted to talk about when Isabella and I met with him in November), he would
 have little difficulty recruiting a group of appropriate CEOs to form an "advisory council on Haitian infrastructure" (which

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773048 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

then could springboard to greater things and deeper commitments). If you could reach out to the appropriate person on
President Clinton's staff, we of course would be available to assist in giving shape to the concept, compiling a list of
names of infrastructure CEOs, etc.

2.	          On a much more personal note, two friends of Isabella and mine,	                        were in the final	          B6
stages of adopting two infants out of a Haitian orphanage when the earthquake struck. Since that time, the process has

obviously stopped and they have had no word on the fate of these two babies, their welfare or the prospects for getting
them out of their earthquake-ravaged environment into their new home and family in the United States. I have attached
a significant amount of detail about the babies, the orphanage, etc.

Burns, I know President Clinton is devoting all of his herculean energy to humanitarian relief for Haiti at the macro level,
but knowing his humanistic approach, there must be someone on his staff who can help with these t •e of individual

situations. Is it possible for you to find that person so that I can make the request and so our friend	             can
provide him/her with any additional information that they might need?

I really appreciate your assistance with respect to both of these matters. Please do not hesitate to contact me night or

day on my cell phone

Come visit us in Princeton.

Best regards,

David Crane

 A momentous 40 hours, leading to Clinton/China/Internet

 21 Jan 2010 04:12 pm
 Apart from two obvious pieces of momentous news in the past day-and-a-half -- the new junior Senator from

 Massachusetts, and the new Buckley v. Valeo &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckley_v._Valeo    &gt; (by which I mean
 today's lamentable, straight-party-line Supreme Court ruling

 &lt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703699204575016942930090152.html           &gt; that removes limits from
 direct corporate underwriting of political campaigns) -- there is one other event today that will have big ripple effects. I

 mean SecState Hillary Clinton's speech this morning about "Internet Freedom," mentioned here
 &lt;http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/hillary_clintons_internetfree.php    &gt; and with a prelude

 discussion here &lt;http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/interesting_chinagoogle_discus.php     &gt; .

 I'm not going to take time for a thorough gloss of the speech. Instead I highly recommend reading the full text, here
 &lt;http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm       &gt;, or watching the official video, here

 &lt;http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1705667530?bctid=62730021001       &gt; . And for now some of the main
 points while listening (and noting main points down in real time with the handy LiveScribe

 &lt;http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/07/my_new_favorite_gadget_li.php      &gt; pen.)

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case         No.  F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773054 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

- In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago -- I'm not naming names, but I remember! -- when

many people imagined that info technology, by itself, would undermine oppression and bring the world together,
Clinton started off with a very astringent reminder that this technology, like others, was neither good or bad in itself and
is already being used in both helpful and destructive ways:

        "Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity, we must also recognize that these technologies are not an

unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political rights. Just as steel
can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energize a city or destroy it, modern

information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for good or for ill. The same networks that
help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida to spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And
technologies with the potential to open up access to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by

governments to crush dissent and deny human rights."

And a very nice pivot out of this section, effective because it's so blunt and plain:

        "On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the United
States does."

- Underscoring the "this is a big deal" tone of the speech, she enumerated the "Four Freedoms
&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms
                                                &gt; "that FDR proclaimed in 1941, as part of the struggle for the world's
future, and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for the Internet age. Check out the speech yourself for
details.

- The China surprise: the speech was a More frontal challenge to Chinese internet and overall censorship policy than I
expected, and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance, early in the speech, an

itemization of the places where suppression is getting worse:

         "In the last year, we've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, and Uzbekistan
have stepped up their censorship of the internet. In Vietnam, access to popular social networking sites has suddenly
disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were detained."

Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government, in its recent

sense of rise to superpower status, is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power, OK;
overtaking Japan in economic size, yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations... all that is one thing.
Bracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this don't appear in formal, big-

deal SecState addresses by accident.

Other passages to the same effect:

         "As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the

 records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics....

         "Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy, our
government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and
 international condemnation...."

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773054 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

And then the Google section itself.
I had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Main

argument for leaving it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company's ongoing efforts to find
a "win-win-win &lt;http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/behind_on_google-china-ology.php          &gt; "
acceptable way to remain in China, rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split, it's not necessarily a help to have the

U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant: as a proxy
for China's own ability to fulfill its potential
&lt;http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/about_the_stakes_for_china_in.php         &gt; and sustain its economic

rise:

        "To use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an environment of
censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. If corporate decision makers

don't have access to global sources of news and information, investors will have less confidence in their decisions over
the long term. Countries that censor news and information must recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is
no distinction between censoring political speech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied

access to either type of information, it will inevitably impact on growth.

         "Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater consideration

in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay close attention to this trend.
The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities
to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for

that investigation and its results to be transparent.

         "The internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are so many

 people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet
 users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the United States and China have different
views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences candidly and consistently in the context of our positive,

 cooperative, and comprehensive relationship."

 There's a lot more in the speech, including about terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- but it's there for the reading.
 Back to the to-do list for me now.
                                                                                                     &gt;

         Very interesting report. By chance,   I met with our insightful 	                    in Benghazi yesterday and we discussed                B6

          the LMB's electoral prospects. He didn't think they would have a large following b/c they don't have a strong
          organization and because most Libyans view the LMB as a branch of the Egyptian MB, and Libyans don't want to be

          ruled by Egypt. He did not mention the interesting point below about the LMB as a counterbalance to the eastern based
          Federalists. He did emphasize, though, that the Federalist movement has widespread support in the east and will

          continue to up the ante with Tripoli, including possibly making a move on the oil production in that part of the country
          (AGOCO, a large state-owned oil company, is based in Benghazi). -- Chris

         Below is the latest report fromHRC's contact; would be interested in your reactions.

         SOURCE:
           Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European

         Governments, the Egyptian MuslimBrotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services.

                1.
           During the last week of March 2012, the leaders of the National Transitional Council (NTC) regime in Libya discussed

         the rising popularity and independence of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB) in preparation for the national
         parliamentary elections scheduled for July 2012.

           According to a source with direct access to these discussions, President Mustafa Abclel Jalil stated in very direct terms
         that he sees the emergence of the LMB as a major factor in the upcoming elections, which are already complicated by

         the Federalist movement for the semi autonomous status of the historic Eastern Libyan region of
           Cyrenaica (Barge inArabic).
           Minister of Defense Ousarra al Juwali and Prime Minister Abdurrahirn el Keib both believe that the rise of the LMB,

         whichwas a    relativelyminormemberoftheNTCuntil November2011, is, infact, relatedtotheFederalistmovement                    fl

Date: 05/13/2015

            According to al Juwali, a native of the Western Libyan region of Zintan, the LMB is drawing strength from people who

           fear that the Federalist movement in Barqa will result in that region dominating the country, gaining control of an
           inordinate share of the country's oil and mineral reserves.

            For his part, Jalil stated that he agrees with Oil Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza that if matters are not resolved by the
           July elections, the unsettled nature of the political process in Libya will damage the country's image as a business

           partner and confuse foreign banks and oil firms attempting to open new contacts with the new Libyan Government, or
           reactivate existing agreements.

                  2.
            According to a sensitive source, while discussing this matter with Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis

           Management Unit in the NTC, Prime Minister el Keib stated that the most problematic aspect of the rise of the LMB is
           the leadership role taken by Islamist militia leader General Abdel HakimAlamin Belhaj.

            In the opinion of this source, the NTC leadership sees Belhaj as one of the greatest threats to the long termsuccess of
           their regime.

            Al Juwali also notes that Belhaj is the head of the founding committee for the LMB's Justice and Construction Party
           (JCP). As the Federalist movement took hold in early March 2012, al Juwali, under instruction fromel Keib and Jalil, met

           with Belhaj and other Western militia leaders to arrange for their support In the event military force is needed to hold
           the country together.

            Belhaj represented the most effective of the Western militias.
                  3.
            According to the Minister of Defense, this situation with the Federalist movement enhanced Belhaj's prestige at the

           time he was working to secure a leadership role in the LMB and the JCP.
            El Keib and Jalil are concerned that, despite the fact that the LMB has a limited base after years of suppression by the

           regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, they will appeal to those Libyans who believe that the NTC regime is
           under the influence of the United States and Western Europe.

            The activities of Belhaj in both the LMB and the JCP reinforce this view.
            Jalil finds this situation frustrating, particularly in the light of his regular assurances that Libya would operate under

           Islamic law, and while maintaining appropriate ties to the West, will remain hostile to Israel.
                 4. (Source Comment:

            In a private conversation, Jalil stated that he is working to balance the internal political realities of Libya against the
          concerns of the international business community.

            The President is concerned that the appointment of BenYezza as Oil Minister in October 2011 provided the JCP with a
          tangible concern to use against NTCcandidates during the July elections.

            After his long experience as a senior official of the Multinational Italian Oil FirmENI, Ben Yezza is viewed by Belhaj and
          many members of the LMB as a symbol of the issue they will pursue in the national election, the idea that NTC, like the

          Qaddafi, regime is corrupt and involved in allowing foreign interests to control the nation's mineral wealth.
            That said, Jalil continues to agree with el Keib that Ben Yezza is an excellent administrator, and in the long run will play

          an important role in effectively managing the nation's mineral wealth.)
                 5.

            According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil and his advisors have been in contact with Supreme Guide Mohamed
          Badie, the leader of the much larger and more powerful Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (EMB).

            This contact is largely based on the President's need to address reports he has received that the LMB is reaching out to
          Badie andhis advisors for support.

            This effort is particularly important given the belief among NTC leaders that the EMB and its Freedomand Justice Party
          (FJP) will control the Government of Egypt as that country moves to civilian rule later in 2012. In the opinion of this

          source, Badie is sympathetic to Jalil's position, especially since the Libyan President and el Keib were members of the
          EMBduring their student days in Egypt.

           The Supreme Guide will, according to Jalil, work to influence the LMB to establish a cooperative effort with the NTC.
           Badie will point out the fact that his ability to cooperate with both the Supreme Council for the Armed Force (SCAF), as

          well as the Salafist al Nour party, helped establish the EMB as the dominant political force in Egypt, while avoiding high
          levels of violence.

                 6.
            (Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source within the EMB agreed that Badie       and  Jalil have spoken in an effort to

          develop a plan to deal with the LMB.

            According to this source, Jalil told Badie that the LMB and the JCP are far more intolerant of foreign business and

           banking interests than the NTC, and a strong showing in the July elections will strengthen Belhaj and other conservative
           Islamists, adversely affecting the Libyan economy, which in turn will cause problems for Egypt as it recovers fromits own

           revolution in 2011.
            Jalil emphasized that at this point the NTC has managed to avoid violent outbursts between competing groups, even in

           the face of the Federalist movement in the East, in a region that borders Egypt.
            He warned that an LMB/JCP victory might change this and lead to increased violence between rival militias that could

           wash over into Egypt.)
                  7.

            According to a sensitive source, the LMB has a complex history and Jalil and el Keib believe this past may hold some
           points which can be used against the Brotherhood and the JCP in the July elections.

            The TNTC leaders know that after Qaddafi came to power in 1969, the LMB was repressed and many of its leaders were
           executed publicly. Eventually the Brotherhood, having reestablished itself in the United States and Europe, entered into

           a dialogue with the Qaddafi regime 1999, and in 2005 began a series of negotiations with SW al-Islam Qaddafi, whose
          goal was to co-opt and neutralize opposition groups, particularly Islamist ones.

                 8.
            According to this individual, Belhaj and the other Islamist leaders mistrusted the LMB during the first months of the

          2011 revolution.
            However, Belhaj eventually established a working relationship with Fawzi Abu Kitef, the head of the Revolutionary

          Brigades Coalition in Eastern Libya and the former deputy defense minister in the NTC. Abu Kltef was a leading figure in
          the LMB who spent more than 18 years in prison, including the notorious facility at Abu SeIlm. Under Abu Kitef and

          leaders like Dr. Abdullah Shamia, who was in charge of the economic committee of the NTC, the Brotherhood
          established itself as a unique group within the Jai	   Keib regime; serving there until they began to plan for

          independent political activity in late 2011 and early 2012.
                 9.

           In early 2012, as the relationship between the NTC and Belhaj and the other Islamists deteriorated in the face of
          regional and ethnic power struggles, the LMB leadership, in coordination with Belhaj began to look at an independent

          political effort in the parliamentary elections. During its first public conference in Benghazi during November 2011, the
          LMB elected a new leader, increased its consultative council membership from 11 to 30 leaders, and decided to form a

          political party; the JCP.
           Mohammed Swan, the former head of the Libyan LMB's Consultative Council, won a tight victory over longtime LMB

          leader Soliman Abd al-Qadr, to become the first leader of the JCP. Bashir al-Kubty was elected General Observer of the
          LMB.

                 10.(Source comment: According to an individual with excellent access, the LMB leaders are sensitive to charges
          that the JCP is a party with a narrow religious agenda, and they encouraged Walid al-Sakran, non-member of the LMB, to

          compete as a candidate for JCPleadership.
           That said Belhaj and other Islamist leaders believe that the LMB is set to follow the electoral path of Islamist success

          seen in Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab countries.
           Belhaj now believes that the country will move forward under sharia law, administered by the Islamist bloc, including

          the LMB/JCP

</span>

         This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
         to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It

         seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
         with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
         strategic depth—his support both financial and military.

            I.	      Report
         During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan

         Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him

         against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are

         being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his

         son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,

         Egypt, and France have deployed paramilitary officers to Benghazi to assist in organizing,

         training, and equipping opposition forces. Qaddafi is convinced that the National Libyan Council

        (NLC), and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Galil have been

        chosen by the foreign powers to replace him. On March 1 advisors to Qaddafi stated that

      Qaddafi's cousin, Col. Ali Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the

      Egyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.

      These individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian

     President Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the

     conversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan

     Air Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel

     forces.

      (Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February

     23, President Assad told General Isam Hallaq,        the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,

     to instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil

     War breaks out in the immediate future.)

      On March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number

     of Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of

     the Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon

     against insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are

     convinced that the    European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the

     immediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for

     opposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in

     and around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister

     Mousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent

     the implementation of the no fly zone.

     The Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a

     military agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father,Hafez al-

     Assad, in the presence of General    Soubhi Haddad, who was the commander in chief of the Air

     Force at the time. Both Air Forces are equipped with Russian materiel and have had long-

     standing, close links with Moscow.

      In exchange for Syria's help, Libya provided financial support to the Syrian state, including funds

      in support of operations carried out by the Syrian intelligence services in Lebanon. Libyan money

      helped Hafez al-Assad bribe his brother Rifaat,        the author of an attempted     coup d'etatin 1983,

      to leave the country and go into exile in Spain and France, where he has remained ever since.

      According to individuals with access to the Syrian military, Damascus has also sent a second

      team of pilots and technicians to Tripoli. These are lower-ranking officers loyal to the regime

      who are specialized in flying helicopters. Before their departure for Tripoli on February 23, they

      met with General Allaq and General Jamil Hasan,           head of Air Force's Intelligence.

      (Source Comment: During the afternoon of 3 March, an associate of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi

     stated that he and the Libyan leaders other family members were concerned over the

     announcement of Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal

     Court (ICC), announced that he was investigating Qaddafi, his sons Khamis, the commander of

     the 32 battalion, and Montasem, as well as the head of Gadhafi's personal security detail, the

     Director-General of the External Security Organization (Abuzaid Dorda), the spokesman of the

     regime (Musa Ibrahim), and the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Mousa Kousa). This source added

     that Saif al-Islam had said that Qaddafi himself found the announcement amusing.)

          <span class="inlinemeta">From: Lord Owen
</span>

          Cody,

          Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and

         strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months
         that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations
         continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout
         outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be

         doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the
         cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to
         go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East
         having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan
         and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on

         domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi
         victory is possible and needs to be weighed in the balance now when deciding what to do.

         I'm more worried than I am ready to say publicly.

         Yours
         David

Re: Berlin speeches

Below are my notes for speeches in Berlin. The themes I stress are these: the importance of Berlin and the Brandenburg

Gate as symbols of freedom; the weight of history (always felt by Germans); the contribution of the US and the salience
of the Western alliance; the meaning of 1989 to today and especially the continuity of the Western alliance; and segue

from past to future.

What I have not done here but might be added are references to Angela Merkel (a courageous woman from the east
who embodies the highest values of the West); and specific policies. Those can be fitted in.

So, some ideas and language:

Twenty years ago the wall fell. Here, in Berlin, the moment when tens of thousands of citizens tore it down with

hammers and picks and bare hands is called "Die Wende," a phrase that means more than simply a change but a turning
point in history. It was not only a turning point for Germany and Europe but also for the United States because the

wall—the reason for its construction and the reason for its destruction—is central to our common history—and to our
common future.

Richard von Weizsaecker said, "As long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed, the German question will remain open."

Today I can say with finality, the German question is closed, because the Brandenburg Gate is wide open! The gate is
open, Europe is open, and our future together is open.

In the forty years from the Berlin airlift to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Atlantic partnership proved itself the most

successful alliance for freedom in history. That alliance was, is and shall be the crowning achievement of American
foreign policy. And the German – American relationship has always served as its foundation. Our alliance represents the

reconciliation of former enemies, an inspiration to other peoples and continents devastated by war and hatred, and it
must never be taken for granted.

In the twenty years since the fall of the wall we have created architecture for an enduring peace. Instead of a wall we

have built a gateway to the future. President Kennedy said in 1963 that in the future free men everywhere will say, "Ich
 binemn Berliner." Today Berlin has gained a new and even more powerful meaning. Forever into the future, the opening

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760184 Date: 06/30/2015</span>

of this Gate will be the symbol of the return of the dream of freedom, not only to Berlin and Germany, but to the entire

world.

The Gate, we must remember, was not built as a symbol of freedom. And each of the tyrannies that used the Gate as a

symbol believed it represented their eternal power. The Gate was first erected as a symbol against the French
Revolution; then it became a symbol of the imperial ambitions of Napoleon who marched his army through. It was a

symbol of Prussian militarism and monarchy. It was seized by the Nazi Party as the symbol of its 1000 year rule. And
then it became a symbol of the Communist totalitarianism that built a wall to separate the people of Berlin as though

freedom could be contained in only one part of the city. Here, in Berlin, the Cold War was coldest.

We celebrate the fact that the wall that marred this proud city was taken down by the world's most enthusiastic
wrecking crew. The United States always believed in the freedom of Berlin because we believed in the future of

freedom. The courageous citizens of East Germany, Poland and other nations of the Communist bloc demonstrated their
dedication to free and peaceful solution of conflicts through their stand against dictatorship. America stood resolutely as

an ally at every moment of this struggle and moved swiftly to help the peoples of Europe reunite after 1989.

We celebrate the steadiness of purpose, the restraint and respect for ultimate goals that allowed the Cold War to end in
peace. For how the victory was won was essential to the triumph. 1989 was special. It was that rarest of historical

events: a revolution that did not descend into violence. As a result the Gate survives not as a cautionary monument to
history's darkest moments but to its brightest. Today we celebrate the revolution of 1989, the turning point that

transformed the Brandenburg Gate into the symbol of the hope of democracy and the promise of freedom.

Berliner Luft, the air of Berlin, has always been unique. I can feel and smell the spirit of freedom in your streets. The
great American poet Carl Sandburg called Berlin the Chicago of Europe. Chicago is where I was born and raised. I can

sense the same energy, openness and dedication to hard work in both great cities. Another Chicagoan, President Barack
Obama, was drawn to Berlin last July, a city that he said made him feel like a citizen of the world and a citizen of the

future.

I was very proud to visit our new Embassy at the Brandenburg Gate, located exactly where the Wall used to run. Our
presence here will forever underscore our determination that the spark of freedom from this city in 1989 will help light

the torches of freedom throughout the world.

The revolution of 1989 did not mark the end of history. Having made history together, we are summoned to secure
freedom for future generations. As vital at the beginning of the 21st century as it was in the last half of the 20th, the

Western alliance is called to new tasks. The dreams of 1989 reached far—and have farther to reach. Old hatreds and
conflicts—in the Balkins, the Caucauses, in the Middle East, East Asia, and Africa—still simmer. We have much to

demonstrate what we have learned from the last century. Without freedom, without the rule of law, without the
opportunity for people to support themselves and their families – without basic human rights-- anger, aggression and

violence will prevail.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760184 Date: 06/30/2015</span>

Today we are faced with difficult and often dangerous conflicts arising not from conflicts between nations but within
them, conflicts exploited by zealots who make the false claim that violence will purify the world and open the gates of

heaven. Once zealots tried to use this Gate to symbolize that message. But through the courage and determination of

the people of Berlin and their stalwart allies, this Gate now stands for a true revolution of the spirit. The long twilight
struggle to tear down this wall to make Europe whole and free inspires us, in this new century, to help other peoples

gain the same measure of security, respect and progress.

We need Berlin more than ever today. We need your courage, your fortitude, your commitment to the rights of men—
and women—we need your example. We are hardly at the end of the history of the West. Standing here, where a wall

once stood but is no more, in the light from the Gate, we have learned from history's deepest lessons. Our alliance,
linked by shared struggle, dedicated to the ideals of freedom and democracy, strong from the world we have built, now

faces a new world of challenges. And we are ready to meet and conquer them. We know it has been done before. We
are free men—and women—and proud to say, We are all Berliners.

Under Secretary McHale:

This week we have seen the most extraordinary series of public attacks on the United States by Lt Gen (ret) Hamid Gul, a

noted anti-American crackpot who derives his role as an "expert analyst" by being the only former Inter-Services
Intelligence (151) Chief who ever appears on TV. Gul was briefly ISI chief during PM Bhutto's first term in office almost 20

years ago. Appearing on several TV stations this week, Gul has repeated allegations that the U.S. is implicated in the
Bhutto Assassination — the subject is current this week because of the release of the U.N. report on the assassination,

which is itself a remarkable document.

One ironic element of the UN report on the assassination is the report that on October 16, 2007 former PM Bhutto
wrote to General Musharraf that the very same Hamid Gul was one of three people she considered a threat to her

security. (see excerpt below) This fact came up in none of the programs.

Our view is that the television journalists and executives now must begin taking responsibility for putting inciting and
unsubstantiated claims on the air. We have released the attached "Correction," which will be seen by news editors

across the country.

Excerpt from the UN report on the Bhutto assassination:

179. On 16 October 2007, Ms Bhutto writing from Dubai to General Musharraf, identified three people she considered a
threat to her security: (i) Brigadier (ret) Ejaz Shah, Director General of the IB at the time of the assassination, (ii) General

(ret) Hamid Gul, a former Director General of the ISI, and (iii) Mr Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, Chief Minister of Punjab until
22 November 2007.

</span>

If wasn't as sharp as it should be because it was the first question and I hadn't collected my thoughts:

QUESTION: Okay. What would be — I have some specific questions, but

before I ask them —specific ones, maybe just from your perspective, I
think there — what is it that you think she accomplished as Secretary

of State?

And also, there's another thing that's a little trickier to get at,

but I think it's important, which is that any principal in these
administrations, they have an influence within the administration

that's not always manifest. Sometimes they don't. Sometimes their
advice isn't accepted. But since we're on background and we're not

quoting you and all that stuff unless — without your permission, maybe
you could give us our take on what you think she's accomplished and

where she was — maybe worked within the administration, as any
principal does, to try to shape things.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah. So I guess I can talk about
 my view of her accomplishments at three levels.

 So the first is the most concrete, and that is specific policy

 initiatives and diplomacy that produced results. That list includes a
 major influence on the rebalance to the Asia Pacific in totality and
 with respect to specific elements like South China Sea diplomacy and

 the opening to Burma; her role in putting together the coalition that
 led to the fall of Qadhafi; her role in putting together and holding

 together the coalition on Iran sanctions; her role in putting together
 an effective partnership with ISAF countries to do both the increase

 in troops, including the troop contributions from those other
 countries as well as their contributions to the ANSF and Afghanistan's
 economic development agenda going forward; her role in the Gaza

 ceasefire. [Here you could add the Sudan-South Sudan oil deal, the
 NATO strategic concept, the New START treaty, responding to the coup

 in Honduras, Haiti earthquake response, and her role in national
 security decisions like bin Laden.] So you've got a set of kind of

 very specific accomplishments that you can take a look at.

 The second level is what she did to sort of reorient the building, to

 change the way this building does business. And there you have an
 economic statecraft agenda that has put economics more at the center

 of our foreign policy, both on the commercial diplomacy side and in
 terms of using economics as a tool of statecraft. So in the Middle

 East and North Africa; through the New Silk Road, et cetera. Her
 technology and innovation agenda, putting women at the center of

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05798049 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

basically every aspect of diplomacy and development, elevating
development as a core pillar of American power. So a set of

fundamental institutional changes that really mark a profound
difference in the way diplomacy is practiced and institutional changes
within the State Department from the creation of new bureaus to

changed practices, changed training, changed promotion principles and
so forth, that are all sort of collectively embodied in the QDDR but

can be parceled out in more concrete terms.

And then the third and I think most profound impact that she's had

over the last four years has to do with American — the question of
American leadership and what diplomacy looks like today as compared
with 60 years ago. So your present at the creation generation, your

Achesons, basically could create a few major organizations, and that
is the global architecture —the UN, the Bretton-Woods system, NATO.

Today you don't — you have to deal with an exponentially greater
number of actors, both on the government side and the nongovernment
side. So it's not about creating or advancing a couple of

institutions. It's about putting the U.S. at the center of an
incredible number of different types of partnerships and networks,

some of which are formal institutions, some of which are strategic
dialogues, some of which are public-private.

 And if you look at the list of things that she has done to build that
 and the way in which she has made the job of Secretary of State be a
 constant gardener. From the Global Counterterrorism Forum to the

 Climate and Clean Air Coalition to her work with ASEAN and the Arab
 League and the AU to this entire operation around public-private
 partnerships to her reaching beyond government to engage with the

 private sector, civil society, et cetera, that, I think, is going to
 have to be the way that the United States practices leadership in
 mobilizing coalitions of actors to solve global problems. And it's

 going to be marked by persistent shoe-leather diplomacy combined with
 kind of innovative networks and new ways of doing business. And the
 results are going to come drop by drop as opposed to in big sweeping

 changes.

 And I think her recognizing the moment that we're in, the landscape

 that we face, and adjusting America's role and the role of American
 diplomacy is probably going to end up over time being her most

 profound legacy.

 And just on that point, I would add that it's easy to forget now four

 years later just what a deep hole we were in when she came into
 office. So much of the work that she had to do was repair work,
 restoring our alliances, both in Europe and in the Asia Pacific;

 strengthening partnerships with the emerging powers that were on more
 shaky foundations; returning the United States to the center of
 various international institutions; elevating our standing and our

 voice at not just policy levels but at values levels. And now we're
 sort of used to an Obama-Clinton era in foreign policy, but back when

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05798049 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

we started things looked a heck of a lot different. So she deserves a
lot of credit for that too.

Date: 05/13/2015

          SOURCE:

            Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European
          Governments, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services.

                 1.
            During the last week of March 2012, the leaders of the National Transitional Council (NTC) regime in Libya discussed

          the rising popularity and independence of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB) in preparation for the national
          parliamentary elections scheduled for July 2012.

           According to a source with direct access to these discussions, President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated in very direct terms
          that he sees the emergence of the LMB as a major factor in the upcoming elections, which are already complicated by

          the Federalist movement for the semi-autonomous status of the historic Eastern Libyan region of
           Cyrenalca (Barqa in Arabic).

           Minister of Defense Ousama at Juwali and Prime Minister Abdurrahim el Keib both believe that the rise of the LMB,
          which was a relatively minor member of the NTC until November 2011, is, in fact, related to the Federalist movement in

          Eastern Libya.
           According to al Juwali, a native of the Western Libyan region of Zintan, the LMB is drawing strength from people who

          fear that the Federalist movement in Barqa will result in that region dominating the country, gaining control of an
          inordinate share of the country's oil and mineral reserves.

           For his part, Jalil stated that he agrees with Oil Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza that if matters are not resolved by the
          July elections, the unsettled nature of the political process in Libya will damage the country's image as a business

          partner and confuse foreign banks and oil firms attempting to open new contacts with the new Libyan Government, or
          reactivate existing agreements.

                 2.
           According to a sensitive source, while discussing this matter with Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis

          Management Unit in the NTC, Prime Minister el Keib stated that the most problematic aspect of the rise of the LMB is
         the leadership role taken by Islamist militia leader General Abdel HakimAlamin Belhaj.

           In the opinion of this source, the NTC leadership sees Belhaj as one of the greatest threats to the long termsuccess of
         their regime.

           Al Juwali also notes that Belhaj is the head of the founding committee for the LMB's Justice and Construction Party
         (JCP). As the Federalist movement took hold in early March 2012, al Juwali, under instruction from el Keib and Jalil, met
         with Belhaj and other Western militia leaders to arrange for their support in the event military force is needed to hold

         the country together.
           Belhaj represented the most effective of the Western militias.

                3.
           According to the Minister of Defense, this situation with the Federalist movement enhanced Belhaj's prestige at the

         time he was working to secure a leadership role in the LMB and the JCP.
           El Keib and Jalil are concerned that, despite the fact that the LMB has a limited base after years of suppression by the

         regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, they will appeal to those Libyans who believe that the NTC regime is
         under the influence of the United States and Western Europe.

          The activities of Belhaj in both the LMB and the JCP reinforce this view.
          Jalil finds this situation frustrating, particularly in the light of his regular assurances that Libya would operate under

         Islamic law, and while maintaining appropriate ties to the West, will remain hostile to Israel.
                4. (Source Comment:

           In a private conversation, Jalil stated that he is working to balance the internal political realities of Libya against the
         concerns of the international business community.

          The President is concerned that the appointment of BenYezza as Oil Minister in October 2011 provided the JCP with a
         tangible concern to use against NTCcandidates during the July elections.

           After his long experience as a senior official of the Multinational Italian Oil Firm[NI, Ben Yezza is viewed by Belhaj and
         many members of the LMB as a symbol of the issue they will pursue in the national election, the idea that NTC, like the

         Qaddafi, regime is corrupt and involved in allowing foreign interests to control the nation's mineral wealth.

           According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil and his advisors have been in contact with Supreme Guide Mohamed

         Badie, the leader of the much larger and more powerful Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (EMB).
          This contact is largely based on the President's need to address reports he has received that the LMB is reaching out to

         Badie and his advisors for support.
          This effort is particularly important given the belief among NTC leaders that the EMB and its Freedom and Justice Party
         (FJP) will control the Government of Egypt as that country moves to civilian rule later in 2012. In the opinion of this

         source, Badie is sympathetic to Jalil's position, especially since the Libyan President and el Keib were members of the
         EMB during their student days in Egypt.

          The Supreme Guide will, according to Jalil, work to influence the LMB to establish a cooperative effort with the NTC.
          Sadie will point out the fact that his ability to cooperate with both the Supreme Council for the Armed Force (SCAF), as

         well as the Salafist al Nour party, helped establish the EMB as the dominant political force in Egypt, while avoiding high
         levels of violence.

                6.
          (Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source within the EMB agreed that Badie and Jalil have spoken in an effort to

         develop a plan to deal with the LMB.
          According to this source, Jalil told Badie that the LMB and the JCP are far more intolerant of foreign business and

         banking interests than the NTC, and a strong showing in the July elections will strengthen Belhaj and other conservative
         Islamists, adversely affecting the Libyan economy, which in turn will cause problems for Egypt as it recovers fromits own

         revolution in 2011.
          Jaill emphasized that at this point the NTC has managed to avoid violent outbursts between competing groups, even in
         the face of the Federalist movement in the East, in a region that borders Egypt.

          He warned that an LMB/JCP victory might change this and lead to increased violence between rival militias that could
         wash over into Egypt.)

                7.
          According to a sensitive source, the LMB has a complex history and Jalil and el Keib believe this past may hold some

         points which can be used against the Brotherhood and the JCP in the July elections.
          The TNTC leaders know that after Qaddafi came to power in 1969, the LMB was repressed and many of its leaders were

         executed publicly. Eventually the Brotherhood, having reestablished itself in the United States and Europe, entered into
         a dialogue with the Qaddafi regime 1999, and in 2005 began a series of negotiations with Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, whose

         goal was to co-opt and neutralize opposition groups, particularly Islamist ones.
                8.

          According to this individual, Belhaj and the other Islamist leaders mistrusted the LMB during the first months of the
         2011 revolution.
          However, Belhaj eventually established a working relationship with Fawzi Abu Kitef, the head of the Revolutionary

         Brigades Coalition in Eastern Libya and the former deputy defense minister in the NTC. Abu Kitef was a leading figure in
         the LMB who spent more than 18 years in prison, including the notorious facility at Abu Selim. Under Abu Kitef and

         leaders like Dr. Abdullah Shamia, who was in charge of the economic committee of the NTC, the Brotherhood
         established itself as a unique group within the Jalil/el Keib regime; serving there until they began to plan for

         independent political activity in late 2011 and early 2012.
                9.

         In early 2012, as the relationship between the NTC and Belhaj and the other Islamists deteriorated in the face of
         regional and ethnic power struggles, the LMB leadership, in coordination with Belhaj began to look at an independent

         political effort in the parliamentary elections. During its first public conference in Benghazi during November 2011, the
         LMB elected a new leader, increased its consultative council membership from 11 to 30 leaders, and decided to form a

         political party; the JCP.
         Mohammed Swan, the former head of the Libyan LMB's Consultative Council, won a tight victory over longtime LMB

         leader Solirnan Abd al-Qadr, to become the first leader of the JCP. Bashir al-Kubty was elected General Observer of the
         LMB.
                10.
                   (Source comment: According to an individual with excellent access, the LMB leaders are sensitive to charges
         that the JCP is a party with a narrow religious agenda, and they encouraged Walid al-Sakran, non-member of the LMB, to

         compete as a candidate for JCPleadership.
          That said Belhaj and other Islamist leaders believe that the LMB is set to follow the electoral path of Islamist success

         seen in Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab countries.

          Re: Libyan leadership and militias

          SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the

          highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.

                 1. During the last week of December      2011, and the first week of  2012,  Libya's Prime Minister
          Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jail engaged in a series of emergency planning

          meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National
          Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict
          confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional
          militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the regime of Muaimnar al Qaddafi, as well as

          the related issue of finding ministers and senior administrators for the new government who are
          acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on
          December 23,    2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's office and demanded better

          treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi
          advisors from the new government.
                 2. (Source Comment:       In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned

          the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist
          supporters. By staying out of the new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he
          can criticize their actions and appointments without concern or control,. That said, el — Keib has been

          told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even Belhaj has been surprised that the
          unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting between groups that previously shared
          the same goals and operated under Belhars loose command. This is particularly true in the case of
          the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)

                 3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
          removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a
          particular target of the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and
          most influential advisors are experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with
         Western firms and governments. The most influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
          Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam, National Oil Company chief Nun          i Berrusien, and Nge,b

         Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
                 4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jail are also very
         concerned over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments
         and firms. Belhaj and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western
         entities, using them as a weapon to weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national
         security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional

         commanders, and the national army, a potentially dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of
         Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this individual, believes that he must settle
         this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among foreign allies and businesses
         contacts.)
                 5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by

         General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army.
         Haftar, who lived in the United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a
         relationship with the U.S. Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular
         NTC army to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia
         leaders and in late December 20liel-Keib named deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-
         Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is a problematic choice, since el-

         Keit) is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who commanded one of
         Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual believes that el-
         Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister of
         Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters,
         particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-
         Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible,

         before the supporters of the two claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in
         private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the
         Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
                 6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jalil are attempting to
         reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi
         Abd All as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as

         Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as
         the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living
         standards are met.
                7,  (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he
         is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the

         militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting
         among rival groups that could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability
         will cause Western governments, firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long
         term relationships with Libya. El-Keil3 believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same
         judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created by this violence, by establishing a conservative
         Islamic Republic.)

                  officer corps of the regular Nrc   army to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced

                  heated protests from militia leaders and in late December 2011el-Keib named deputy Minister of
                  Defense Colonel Yussef al-Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is
                  a problematic choice, since el-Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-

                  Mangoush who commanded one of Qaddafrs elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution
                  began. This individual believes that el-Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward
                  Haftar, and the influence of Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from
                  resolved, as Haftar and his supporters, particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim

                  that the General is the true Chief of Staff, El-Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of
                  the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible, before the supporters of the two claimants
                  begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in private that he fully expects Belhaj to
                  attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the Colonel is the only officer strong

                  enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
                          6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jalil are attempting to
                  reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader

                  Fawzi Abd Ali as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan
                  militia, as Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with
                  limited success, as the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their
                  demands regarding living standards are met

                          7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact
                  that he is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not
                  disarm the militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of

                  increased fighting among rival groups that could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that
                  the ongoing instability will cause Western governments, firms, and banks, to hesitate before
                  committing themselves to long term relationships with Libya. El-Keib believes that Belhaj and
                  his advisors have made the same judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created by this

                  violence, by establishing a conservative Islamic Republic.)

 &lt;http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/html/newsletterlmages/PollockThumb.jpg           &gt; (WASHINGTON) -- Beyond the
headlines and YouTube videos of demonstrators in Cairo's Tahrir Square, there are more than 80 million Egyptian

citizens whose attitudes suddenly matter a great deal. Do they support or oppose the Muslim Brotherhood? Who would
win a truly free Egyptian presidential election? Do Egyptians want to tear up their peace treaty with Israel, or to uphold
it?

To answer these and other crucial questions, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy is pleased to release the first-
ever reliable public opinion poll of Egyptians on these issues, taken by telephone in the midst of the current political

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778838 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

upheaval. The results provide an eye-opening and unprecedented perspective on how the Egyptian public -- rather than

the pundits and the politicians -- is reacting to these remarkable and historic events.

The poll was conducted by a professional, Egyptian-led field teamsupervised by Pechter Middle East Polls, a respected

independent polling company based in Princeton, New Jersey. Dr. David Pollock, a senior fellow at The Washington
Institute and former chief of Near East/South Asia research at the U.S. Information Agency and Department of State,
directed the project.

The results of the poll are taken from nearly 350 interviews selected by random-digit dialing of both landline and cell
phones in Cairo and Alexandria -- a sample large enough to be representative of the entire population of Egypt's two

major metropolises -- with an approximately 6 percent margin of error. The interviews were conducted from Saturday,
February 5 through Tuesday, February 8, 2011.

The following is Dr. Pollock's summary of the poll's key findings:

1.	     This is not anIslamic uprising. The MuslimBrotherhood is approved by just 15 percent of Egyptians -- and its
leaders get barely 1 percent of the vote in a presidential straw poll. Asked to pick national priorities, only 12 percent of

Egyptians choose sharia (Islamic law) over Egypt's regional leadership, democracy, or economic development. And,
when asked to explain the uprising, the issues of economic conditions, corruption, and unemployment (around 30
percent each) far outpace the concern that "the regime is not Islamic enough" (only 7 percent).

 &lt;http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/html/newsletterlmages/pollock-Egyptpoll-3.jpg&gt; 2.	           Surprisingly, when

asked two different ways about the peace treaty with Israel, more support it (37 percent) than oppose it (27 percent) --
although around a third say they "don't know" or refuse to answer this question. Only 18 percent of Egyptians approve
either Hamas or Iran. And a mere 5 percent say the uprising occurred because their government is "too pro-Israel."

3.	     Even more surprisingly, opposition figure Mohamed ElBaradei has very little popular support -- just 3 percent --

in a presidential straw vote. He is far outpaced by former foreign minister and current Arab League secretary-general
Amr Mousa, who gets 25 percent. But President Mubarak and his new vice president, General Omar Suleiman, each
garner 16-17 percent of support in this poll.

</span>
MEXICO CITY (AP) - Newly released diplomatic cables indicate Mexico let U.S. agents question
undocumented migrants held in Mexican detention centers as part of anti-terror efforts, despite the country's
traditional sensitivity about national sovereignty.
The latest round of WikiLeaks cables released over the weekend paint a picture of a nation extremely eager for

U.S. aid in security matters, in the face of its own disorganized intelligence sector and threats from drug cartels.

Those threats included a report that a crime gang plotted to bring down President Felipe Calderon's airplane
with a grenade launcher, though no such attack ever took place.

A May 2008 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Mexico expressed concern about Mexico being used as a
"potential transit point for terrorists intending to launch attacks against the U.S."
"On a positive note," the cable noted that Mexico's domestic intelligence agency "has allowed U.S. government

officers to interview foreign nationals detained at Mexican immigration detention centers dispersed around the
country for potential CT (counterterrorism) information."
Most people held at Mexican immigration facilities are undocumented Central American migrants, but the
Americans were apparently worried that terrorists from other continents might be using established human

smuggling routes and networks.
A February 2010 cable said Calderon "is also concerned that organized criminal groups may try to establish
contacts with terrorists." It said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano responded that "although we
have not seen evidence to this effect, the potential is there."

U.S. and Mexican officials have refused to comment on the specifics of leaked communications. In December,
Mexico's federal security spokesman Alejandro Poire said "the contents of the cables, in many cases, reflect
personal points of view, are inexact, or taken out of context."
Other cables display a grim assessment of Mexico's ability to fight drug cartels, saying the country has limited

intelligence-gathering capacity and quoting Calderon as saying politicians could be tempted to return to a tacit
policy of tolerating the gangs.
According to an April 2009 cable, a U.S. official asked him "if there was political momentum to go back to the
old practice of looking the other way."

"Calderon replied, 'There is a serious risk," the document said. "Certain sectors in the past made informal
agreements with criminals in exchange for a degree of security, and they are arguing for that again."
The same cable said Mexico is very grateful for U.S. aid.
"Thanks to equipment the U.S. had provided, the government had managed to thwart a planned assassination of

a key politician in one state," it said, without identifying the politician.
 The 2010 cable also said Calderon requested U.S. help in clamping down on violence in Ciudad Juarez, where
about 6,000 people have died in drug-related killings in the last two years.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778290 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

According to the document, Napolitano replied that the multi-agency El Paso Intelligence Center "can help to

identify the right organized crime targets, but that Mexico must move beyond military deployments and
establish a police capacity in Ciudad Juarez capable of policing every block and street."
Calderon apparently favored implementing a "zero-tolerance" policy targeting even minor crimes, a strategy
Mexico has not yet put in place. But he expressed wariness about committing army troops to tasks like border

control, fearing that in the long term they would be corrupted.
A November 2009 cable described Mexico's intelligence services as "fractured, ad hoc, and reliant on the
United States for leads and operations."
"Many successful captures of important cartel figures are often backed by U.S. assistance," it said.

As an example, it cited the Mexican military's poor communication with its own locally deployed troops: Army
intelligence units see "local military commands as often penetrated by organized crime," it said. "Military units
deployed to hotspots operate virtually blind except for anonymous tips."
The cables also noted interagency mistrust between federal police, the military and prosecutors, fueled by

personal rivalries among top officials.
One mentioned fears that the United States, which has provided training for 4,952 Mexican soldiers and officers
since 1996, might have inadvertently trained future members of the ultra-violent Zetas drug gang, which was
founded by deserters from an elite Mexican army unit.
But the Embassy said a search of databases turned up only one case in which someone who was forcibly

recruited to a Zetas plot may have received some U.S. training years before.

Diplomacy in Tough Places

I'm a United States diplomat and I believe in diplomacy in tough places. Far away from the cocktail parties in cushy Western
capitals that still represent the narrow stereotype of my chosen profession, American diplomacy is being practiced in the
most difficult places and under the most challenging of circumstances.

For this Windsor-knotted, pinstriped, wing-tipped American diplomat, and for my many intrepid colleagues of the United
States Foreign Service serving around the world in places where there is no wine, nor cheese, the practice of diplomacy in
tough places has always been the rule rather than the exception.

From Badghis to Bujumbura, from Juba to Muthanna, America's diplomats have consistently answered the call to serve on
 the front lines of diplomacy, representing the breadth and depth of America and all that she stands for. Without the
 camouflage of our uniformed military siblings, the slow and steady cadence of "wing tips" rather than "boots on the ground"
 continues to walk America's ideas closer to foreign audiences around the globe. Through veterinary support to rural farmers,
 technical assistance for local electoral commissions, and strengthening the voices of rural women through artistic expression,

 diplomacy gives America the opportunity to reach that sweet spot of diplomatic engagement; what Edward R. Murrow called,
"the last three feet."

 When earthquakes rumble, when tsunamis roar, when terrorism rages in places most Americans know only from headlines,
 the men and women of the Foreign Service are often tasked with being our nation's first responders.

 My last overseas diplomatic assignment - a year spent on a civilian-led provincial reconstruction team in Iraq's deep south -

 taught me many things about diplomacy. Chief among them was this: in the toughest neighborhoods on earth, when the
 front lines of war transform into the main streets and peace and stability, diplomacy must be first on the scene. It is neither
 convenient, nor always safe, to practice diplomacy in such places, but it is absolutely necessary if America is to successfully
 engage the world.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777325 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

As I head back to Iraq for another year of diplomatic service in a few short days, I count myself fortunate to be among the
many "wing tips on the ground" who represent America and practice diplomacy in tough places.

BETHLEHEM (Reuters) - The EU foreign policy chief called on January 6 for the Quartet of Middle East
mediators to meet early next month to help Israel and the Palestinians overcome a deadlock in peace talks. With

negotiations in limbo for the past three months, the European Union's Catherine Ashton said the EU, Russia, the
United States and United Nations should schedule a high-level meeting to revive the peace process and put it
back on track. "I propose the Quartet meet as soon as possible to help find a solution to the current impasse. The

Munich Security Conference in early February offers a good opportunity," Ashton said at the end of a two-day
visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories. "My trip to the region so early in the year is an expression of my
personal commitment and that of the European Union and its         27 member states to peace in the Middle East,"

she said. "I have urged both Israelis and Palestinians to find a satisfactory way to engage without delay in
substantive negotiations on all final-status issues. There is no alternative to a negotiated solution," she added in

a statement.

Dear Dr. Slaughter:

Dick Holbrooke, writes Leslie Gelb, was a human tidal wave, the most luminescent diplomat of his generation, and a very
controversial and complicated man.

The Richard Holbrooke I Knew
 by Leslie H. Gelb

January 2, 2011 I 10:41pm

**He   was the most dynamic foreign-policy force of his generation. Leslie H. Gelb recalls his dear friend, their political
 partnership, and how Holbrooke pushed to make AfPak work until the very end.**

 Far better to write a novel about Richard C. Holbrooke than a biography, let alone an obituary. Only a novel could render

 his mythic contradictions-his stunning ability to see into the hearts and minds of others, but his blindness to how they
 saw him; his unrivaled gift for knocking down doors and walking smack into them; his infuriating qualities and his

 enormous charm and generosity; his capacity to sit and consume books or movies and his titanic energy to go anywhere
 and do anything; his bullying qualities and willpower coupled with his thin skin, neediness, and fragility; his almost

 childlike ego and his fiery commitments to great causes, indeed his fusion of self and mission. When not obsessing about
 adversaries and transforming them into monsters so he could slay them, he was incomparably interesting and fun.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776274 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

His life and mine have been so intertwined for 45 years that he swims in my head-as unfinished music about the man I
grewup with in the cauldron of foreign affairs and in life. For me, this music conjures his surpassing diplomatic skills, his

gift for Homeric friendship-and his promise, lost.

I don't want the obituaries to swallow him up as a brilliant star who never made it to the top. I want people to

understand why his death is being treated like the passage of a great secretary of State, the position he dearly coveted,
never attained, and so clearly deserved.

Part of it, of course, was that Dick Holbrooke was a character of the first order, a captain of industry in an age of the
bureaucratic personality. It was highly unusual to get through a meal without someone telling some "Holbrooke" story.

(His name was a word unto itself in Washington.) For example, taking five cellphone calls during a meeting, walking out
speaking, returning and immediately telling all present that whatever they were saying while he was out of the room
was either "just wrong" or "not quite right" (his polite put-down). One of my favorites: his coming over to watch sports

on television, talking non-stop during the game while devouring every morsel in sight. His feats of memory about novels
or history were prodigious. Then, there's the story about his playing Donkey Kong in an arcade for hours, stuffing

quarters hither and yon in a frenzied and laughing pursuit of the game's highest honor-an "epic win."

But the main reason the trumpets scream belatedly and ecstatically about Dick Holbrooke is because he attained those

epic wins in diplomacy and was capable of more. He would never be satisfied with mere successes. He yearned to do
great things, to be a great man, to make history, and the history books. That takes an enormous amount of nerve and
ability. Even notable leaders shy away fromsuch tests of will, challenges, and risks of failure. These downsides barely

troubled Holbrooke. He would dare to tread where others feared, and he simply would not give up.

Holbrooke would and could do what others merely gaped at-accomplish meaningful goals and great goals. Frankly, I

don't know a soul in my generation who could replicate his bringing about the Dayton Accords and ending the genocidal
war in Bosnia. He conceived the federal solution to stop the fighting, and he got the Balkan beasts to sign on by knocking
their heads together. Other diplomats would still be playing little games of persuading the beastly parties to be good

boys, seeking compromise, and failing. For forging peace in Bosnia, he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize. Doubtless, some
enemy he had made along the way blackballed him. As for his many other accomplishments, I won't recount them here;
they can be read now in most other reviews of his life.

Let me just tell you a slice of the incredible story of why he accepted the position as President Obama's Special
Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan-and why he soldiered on in the face of poor treatment by the White House

and the virtual impossibility of the task itself.

Dick took the envoy position because the United States faced no greater challenge. The challenge was to stop the killing,

make "a peace" if possible, and sharply diminish America's combat role as quickly as possible. The other reason for
taking the job was that he was devoted to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She was not threatened by his formidable
talents, and she saved his job at least twice. (She also was Herculean in making arrangements to try to save his life when

he was stricken in her office.) They were a great team. And as a practical matter, he was really Clinton's envoy far more
than Obama's.

The answer to the second question-why Holbrooke stayed on given Obama's attitude toward him and the virtual
impossibility of the task-is very complicated. Holbrooke was loyal to the president. He never said a bad word about him

to me, a quite unusual occurrence. But the chemistry didn't work between them. Dick, as was his custom with superiors,
flattered Obama excessively. Dick also "lectured" him, and the president is the kind of guy who felt he ought to be doing
the lecturing. It was a clash as well of two very powerful intellects. Obama could have learned a lot from Holbrooke, but

 wasn't disposed to do so. The result was that Holbrooke wasn't given the power of the Oval Office in doing his job.
Characteristic of the man, if he couldn't do his work one way, he would search for others. But it was hard.

 Fromthe outset, Holbrooke was hamstrung. He knew that Americans and Afghans both had no chance unless the
government in Kabul shaped up. President George W. Bush let President Hamid Karzai do whatever he wanted. So,
 Holbrooke went to Kabul and blasted Karzai for the corruption, inefficiency, and illegitimacy of his government. That was

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776274 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

precisely the right move. Karzai had to understand that Washington was now going to get serious. But Karzai, no fool
and no amateur bargainer himself, told Holbrooke's bosses he wouldn't talk to the envoy, period. Obama let that

injunction stand until fairly recently, and that killed Holbrooke-and the U.S.-with Karzai. Instead, the president should
have responded to Karzai's ploy by picking up the phone and telling the Afghan leader that he would either have to

speak to Holbrooke or he'd speak to no one.

Why did Holbrooke stay on in the face of all this and the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan itself? The answer show
another side of the man. He had little or no illusions about the limitations of American power to defeat the Taliban. But

it was his job, his duty, his mission, to try anyway. So, he did his thing, which was not to create new grand strategies for
solutions. Rather, his style was to learn everything about Afghanistan, then turn on his acute radar and wait for

openings, for chances to ease America into a much more modest role in Afghanistan. He and Mrs. Clinton cooked up the
idea of inserting the word "transition" in the NATO communiqué this past November. It was a wedge to move policy

decisions along a bit faster toward troop drawdowns and turn over responsibility earlier to the Afghans. He also wanted
to test all possible waters for talks with the Taliban, just in case. And he wanted to work with Kabul's neighbors to

establish a future alliance to contain Afghan extremism. As for Pakistan, he hoped to put the leaders there on the same
or similar strategic trajectory with Washington. This was a long shot, but neither he nor the White House was prepared

for more drastic approaches. The point was this: If the United States was not going to walk away from the sinkholes of
AfPak, Dick Holbrooke wasn't going to walk away either. Better in his mind for him than someone else to stay on and

battle out policy at home and abroad.

Richard C. Holbrooke was the most luminescent foreign-policy figure of my generation. He was a unique personality,
brilliant, a great diplomat, irresistible despite his obsessiveness about matters miniscule and mountainous, a

Renaissance man in his interests and knowledge, controversial, beset with detractors almost as legion as admirers, both
a formidable foreign-policy mind and bureaucratic swordsman, both a clever and too obvious manuverer, mesmerizing

in his intellectual sparkle and his energy.

He was the only person I could imagine capable of doing something truly Herculean on the diplomatic front. Friend and
foe alike would agree that he was a human tidal wave.

Dick Holbrooke spent his youth being smart and useful to the titans of yore: Averell Harriman, General Maxwell Taylor,

Henry Cabot Lodge, Clark Clifford, Dean Rusk, Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton. He saw he could be among
them in their international deeds.

Making peace would be his trampoline to greatness and his pedestal.

American Diplomacy Revealed — as Good

By ROGER COHEN

NEW YORK — Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!

They are, to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their private or secret cables, thoughtful, well-
informed and dedicated servants of the American interest who write clear, declarative English sentences.

I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy is now
condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if their

correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they would lose most of their sources. That should give
every journalist pause.

So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet, particularly in the more
conspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable, like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will be

added.
Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but probably shallow

spectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.
Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the "shock" of venal Gulf Arab Sunni

leaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the
"shock" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the "shock" of yet more premature Israeli

predictions on when Iran will have a nuclear weapon; or the "shock" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the
"shock" of the Chinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the "shock" of Muammar el-Qaddafi's taste for voluptuous

Slavic women and Silvio Berlusconi's taste for all women — perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional,
sober and short on embarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with the world as we already

knew it, right down to the familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: "hyperactive," "mercurial,"
"authoritarian," "erratic," "monarch-like."

I swear, if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have become good hacks.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778296 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

Overall, my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats has been redoubled, not least for this
underreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009, contained in a cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai:

"While we don't know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record
high levels and that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that

Ahmadinejad 'won big' in the first round."
It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in

Tehran during the election and its violent aftermath.
A couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as exercised as they are about

Tehran in part because they know that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the United
States. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the

Middle East more than overcoming the U.S.-Iranian psychosis.
The second is that President Barack Obama's approach to Iran has been much more conventional than his initial

outreach suggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross's
tired thinking about balancing "appetizing carrots" with "sharp sticks" in tackling Iran's nuclear program.

The cables reveal that as early as March 2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was talking "dual track," telling Europeans that
"engagement alone is unlikely to succeed" and calling for added "pressure." Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never have

been overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester.
Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy. In an interview with Time, he

expressed approval for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "coming out with a very interesting statement that
leaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can" and bought into Netanyahu's view that this, in

Assange's words, would "lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in
relation to Iran."

Huh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls for a U.S.-led war against Iran, an option
he also favors. And that, for Assange, is a step forward to peace! He's all over the place.

What should we make of this brainy naïf who told my colleague John Burns that America is a threat to democracy? He's
a loose canon; let him be. My impression is he's self-armed with a spade and he's digging.

And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing, offering plenty of voyeuristic titillation but no gasp of
discovery. They provide texture but break little new ground. Yet their publication has done significant damage to the

courageous work of America's diplomats and may endanger lives. That's a tradeoff that I find troubling and
unpersuasive.

Nov. 24

TO: NGO colleagues on New START

RE: ACA comment and analysis of Sen. Jon Kyl's November 24 "Memo on Modernization for Republican Colleagues"

Senators Kyl and Corder have sent a memo to fellow Republican Senators outlining his remaining (minor) concerns
about details in the Obama administration's update of the so-called "Section 1251 Plan" on maintaining and upgrading

the National Nuclear Security Administration's programs to maintain the shrinking number of U.S. nuclear weapons.

There is an early NYTimes story on the memo here &lt;http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/kyl-lays-out-
objections-to-arms-treaty/?scp=1&amp;sq=Kyl%20nuclear&amp;st=cse&gt;

Kyl's memo is attached. ACA observations and my comments for the record (sent to reporters this evening) are pasted

below.

For further background on this subject, see ACA's earlier Issue Brief on "Modernization Myths and Realities"

http://www.armscontroLorg/issuebriefs/modernizationmyths

ACA will post a blog commentary about this over the weekend.

I can be contacted over the Thanksgiving weekend at                     if you get or have questions about this that I might
be able to answer.

NOTE: My sources also tell me that there will be a Kyl oped in the NYTimes this weekend, probably on this and missile

defense-related issues. Be on the alert.

Thanks and have a safe holiday.

- Daryl Kimball, Executive Director, Arms Control Association

Daryl Kimball's background observations about the Kyl memo:

-Senator Kyl is acting in bad faith and is trying to burn time off the clock. His objections are not with the amount of
money the administration is proposing for funding the nuclear weapons complex over the next decade ($85b, nearly

20% higher than funding during the GW Bush years), but the with minute details regarding the pace.

- Senator Kyl has still not offered any substantive objection to the New START treaty itself.

- Senator Kyl is still leaving the door open to a vote on the treaty this year, though his stalling tactics are clearly intended
to delay consideration well into 2011 or later.

- his quote of Sec Gates is two years old. He ignores Gates comment this year about the Obama administration's original

1251 plan and the comments of the lab directors:

Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wrote in his preface to the April 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), "These
investments, and the NPR's strategy for warhead life extension, represent a credible modernization plan necessary to

sustain the nuclear infrastructure and support our nation's deterrent."

In a joint statement on the NPR from the directors of the three nuclear weapons laboratories issued April 9, Sandia's
Tom Hunter, Los Alamos' Michael Anastasio, and Lawrence Livermore's George Miller said: "We are reassured that a key

component of the NPR is the recognition of the importance of supporting 'a modern physical infrastructure--comprised
of the national security laboratories and a complex of supporting facilities--and a highly capable workforce with the

specialized skills needed to sustain the nuclear deterrent.'

- his remaining concerns relate to certain imponderables that hardly merit holding up New START now: he argues that
 UPF and CMRR construction might be delayed by a couple of years unless there is even more money spent early on for

those projects. He is also suggesting the Congress apply a new system of three-year appropriations to the program,
 which would tie the hands of future Congresses and give contractors free reign. And for very little benefit. If future

 Congresses believe that such funding increases are warranted, they should appropriate more money at the appropriate
 time, not now.

 -Kyl wants an "update" of the possible additional needs for increased funding for stockpile surveillance. The stockpile

 surveillance numbers are already higher than under the George W. Bush administration years. At that time Kyl did not
 have any quibble with the adequacy of the administration's budget proposals for the NNSA weapons activities budget.

 -he is objecting to the fact that the United States will not be able to be able to completely replace the entire existing

 stockpile by manufacturing new weapons, which the military and the lab directors do not believe is necessary because
 we are refurbishing existing warheads are reducing our overall stockpile along with Russia, and he is ignoring the fact

 that the United States will maintain a large number of active warheads in a non-deployed reserve.

 - DK

 Comments for the Record from Daryl Kimball on Senator Kyl's memo to Republican colleagues:

 Further attempts by Senator Kyl to delay New START in order to 'earmark' still more funding for the well-funded
 weapons labs is fiscally irresponsible and damaging to U.S. security.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777996 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

The administration's earlier, $85 billion, 10 year proposal to maintain the arsenal through the life-extension programs
and without renewed nuclear testing already provided the weapons labs with more than enough to get the job done.

Sen. Kyl is acting in bad faith. He refuses to take "yes" for an answer. His fellow Republican and the nation are poorly

served by his refusal to heed the advice of American military leadership and national security experts from both parties
who believe that the Obama administration's nuclear weapons complex funding strategy is 'more than enough' to get

the job done and who believe prompt ratification of New START is critical to U.S. national security.

Delaying the vote on New START would damage U.S. national security, undermine cooperative efforts with Russia to

contain Iran's nuclear ambitions, and shatter the fragile political consensus for higher funding to maintain the U.S.
nuclear stockpile in the years ahead.

Interaction op-ed that Raj Shah was told will appear in the Washington Post also appeared in Sunday Daily Times in
Pakistan.

by Samuel A. Worthington

The work that relief and humanitarian organizations carry out in Pakistan is far from easy or safe. We go to difficult areas

and are targets for militants seeking to destroy our lifesaving mission through a campaign of killing, kidnapping and
intimidation.

Overtly branding our efforts as sponsored by the U.S. government — as the Obama administration wants us to do —
only makes our jobs harder and more dangerous.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775856 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

I have the privilege of leading InterAction, an alliance of U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations conducting relief
work around the world; nearly a quarter of our 200 members are responding to the recent floods in Pakistan, and many

of them have been in Pakistan for decades.

Though our efforts are supported by public donations, much of the assistance we deliver — whether food, water,
essential health care or education — comes via funding from the U.S. government. And in recent weeks, the Obama

administration has pressured us to make that link as clear and public as possible. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton questioned our courage, suggesting last month that some NGOs are too "afraid to have association with the U.S.

government" while distributing aid in Pakistan.

None of the NGO workers in Pakistan — living under a daily threat of kidnappings or targeted killings — are cowards.
The dangers they face are immense, and their bravery must be commended as they help people whose lives have been

devastated by terrorism or the epic floods.

Of course, I understand where the administration is coming from. The U.S.-funded assistance we provide saves lives and
helps struggling communities rebuild. In the battle for hearts and minds in Pakistan, U.S. officials argue, the failure to

clearly advertise that the American government is behind this help — with, for instance, logos on medicines or signs on
food-distribution centers — is a missed opportunity. In 2009 the United States approved $7.5 billion in assistance to

Pakistan over the next five years; however, as Washington Post columnist David Ignatius noted recently, Pakistanis read
more about American drone attacks than about these aid dollars.

In countries such as Liberia or Democratic Republic of Congo, U.S. NGOs that get funding from the U.S. government

routinely promote the fact that they are delivering help "from the American people." But in Pakistan, where aid workers'
lives are more often at stake, an enforced branding campaign could undermine our ability to deliver assistance as fast as

possible without being a lightning rod for protests or attacks. It would also put the lives of Americans and their Pakistani
colleagues at risk. (It is usually Pakistani nationals who do the bulk of the work on the ground.)

In an environment where we are often soft targets for militants, drawing attention to our connection to the U.S.

government makes us even more vulnerable.

In March, one of InterAction's most active members in Pakistan, World Vision — which works on issues from health care
to farming to literacy — was attacked in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly called the North-West Frontier Province), and

seven of its employees were killed. And a year ago, the office of the World Food Program in Islamabad was attacked,
and five employees were killed.

There must be a balance among mitigating the risks NGOs face, communicating U.S. goodwill and delivering assistance

effectively. NGOs must be allowed to strike that balance on their own every day — even if the upshot is that we don't

In some cases, particularly in less-volatile regions of Pakistan, conspicuously identifying aid as American may not pose a
threat to our work. But in areas where militants are particularly active, the risks to those delivering the aid may be great.

These judgments must be made by the NGOs on the ground, depending on local circumstances, and not directed by the

State Department's branding concerns.

In Pakistani tribal areas along the Afghan border, for instance, the U.S. Agency for International Development has
granted our members waivers allowing us not to brand U.S. assistance, but there is growing pressure by the government

for these waivers to be phased out. While I agree that U.S. aid to the Pakistani people and government needs to be more
visible, this could put humanitarian workers' lives in jeopardy.

The American people are enormously generous, as shown after Haiti's devastating earthquake in January and in the

aftermath of the December 2004 tsunami in Asia. In Pakistan, the United States — through military and civilian
assistance, as well as through NGOs — is playing a major role in response to the recent floods, which forced at least 15

million people from their homes. The humanitarian groups I represent are providing basics, including clean water,
medicine and shelter.

The debate over branding our efforts is not simply another technical policy decision; for us, it can be a matter of life and

death. NGOs and the Obama administration must work together to find a solution that allows humanitarian workers in
the field flexibility to brand or not, according to security conditions on the ground.

We are ready and eager to have that dialogue. The lives of our front-line workers depend on it.

I agree. As you know I believe passionately that it is not in our national interests to continue to provide billions of dollars

in aid and assistance without the very people we are helping knowing we are the ones providing the assistance. Some of
our research in Pakistan indicates that many people believe the assistancee is coming from China and of course the

Chinese do nothing to correct the record.

I asked INR to provide me with an assessment of the current situation after the floods to determine the impact of our

assistance. I have also asked them to work with the IC to give us an accurate and unbiased assessment of the security
risks involved. I aksed for it a couple of weeks ago so hopefully they will have something we can use now which might be

helpful in drafting a response.

In terms of the security arguments he makes, it is worth noting that the incidents he references are situations where the
attacks occured in places where there was NO USG branding. The reality is that the terrorists attack any group or

institution which might impede their ability to prevail.

I had already planned a USAID/State meeting to address this issue this week. I'll try to get everyone together today or
tomorrow and will report back to you.

  Interaction op-ed that Raj Shah was told will appear in the Washington Post also appeared in Sunday Daily Times in

  Pakistan.

  by Samuel A. Worthington

  The work that relief and humanitarian organizations carry out in Pakistan is far from easy or safe. We go to difficult areas
  and are targets for militants seeking to destroy our lifesaving mission through a campaign of killing, kidnapping and

  intimidation.

  Overtly branding our efforts as sponsored by the U.S. government — as the Obama administration wants us to do —
  only makes our jobs harder and more dangerous.

  I have the privilege of leading InterAction, an alliance of U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations conducting relief

  work around the world; nearly a quarter of our 200 members are responding to the recent floods in Pakistan, and many
• of them have been in Pakistan for decades.

  Though our efforts are supported by public donations, much of the assistance we deliver — whether food, water,

  essential health care or education — comes via funding from the U.S. government. And in recent weeks, the Obama
  administration has pressured us to make that link as clear and public as possible. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham

  Clinton questioned our courage, suggesting last month that some NGOs are too "afraid to have association with the U.S.
  government" while distributing aid in Pakistan.

  None of the NGO workers in Pakistan — living under a daily threat of kidnappings or targeted killings — are cowards.

  The dangers they face are immense, and their bravery must be commended as they help people whose lives have         been
  devastated by terrorism or the epic floods.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775859 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

Of course, I understand where the administration is coming from. The U.S.-funded assistance we provide saves lives and
helps struggling communities rebuild. In the battle for hearts and minds in Pakistan, U.S. officials argue, the failure to

clearly advertise that the American government is behind this help — with, for instance, logos on medicines or signs on

food-distribution centers — is a missed opportunity. In 2009 the United States approved $7.5 billion in assistance to
Pakistan over the next five years; however, as Washington Post columnist David Ignatius noted recently, Pakistanis read

more about American drone attacks than about these aid dollars.

In countries such as Liberia or Democratic Republic of Congo, U.S. NGOs that get funding from the U.S. government
routinely promote the fact that they are delivering help "from the American people." But in Pakistan, where aid workers'

lives are more often at stake, an enforced branding campaign could undermine our ability to deliver assistance as fast as
possible without being a lightning rod for protests or attacks. It would also put the lives of Americans and their Pakistani

colleagues at risk. (It is usually Pakistani nationals who do the bulk of the work on the ground.)

In an environment where we are often soft targets for militants, drawing attention to our connection to the U.S.
government makes us even more vulnerable.

In March, one of InterAction's most active members in Pakistan, World Vision — which works on issues from health care

to farming to literacy — was attacked in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly called the North-West Frontier Province), and
seven of its employees were killed. And a year ago, the office of the World Food Program in Islamabad was attacked,

and five employees were killed.

There must be a balance among mitigating the risks NGOs face, communicating U.S. goodwill and delivering assistance
effectively. NGOs must be allowed to strike that balance on their own every day — even if the upshot is that we don't

include U.S. signs on new health clinics.

In some cases, particularly in less-volatile regions of Pakistan, conspicuously identifying aid as American may not pose a
threat to our work. But in areas where militants are particularly active, the risks to those delivering the aid may be great.

These judgments must be made by the NGOs on the ground, depending on local circumstances, and not directed by the

Tax reform essential for rescuing Pakistan's economy

        S. Akbar Zaidi &lt;http://list.carnegieendowment.org/t/724354/11330778/57217/0/        &gt; is a visiting scholar in the

Carnegie Endowment's South Asia Program. A visiting professor at Columbia University, with a joint appointment in the
School of International Public Affairs and the Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies, his
research focuses on development, governance, and political economy in South Asia.

Zaidi taught economics at the University of Karachi from 1983 to 1996 before becoming a visiting scholar at the
University of Oxford (1998) and later a research fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Institute for the Advanced

Study of India in New Delhi (2002-2003). From 2004 to 2005 he was a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins School of
Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and in 2008 he was a Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellow at the National

 Endowment for Democracy.

Zaidi's twelfth book, Military, Civil Society and Democratization in Pakistan, is to be published by Vanguard Press, Lahore

in October 2010.

 Unable to sustain solid growth, Pakistan's economy is teetering on the brink of collapse, with one-third of the population
 living below the poverty line. S. Akbar Zaidi writes in a new brief that Pakistan's economic instability stems in large part

 from low government revenue due to the elite's use of tax evasions, loopholes, and exemptions. Without tax reform,
 Pakistan will continue to run an unsustainable debt and be forced to rely on Western donors for bailouts.

 » &lt;http://carnegieendowment.oreemailiskin/2010/actionLeftEnd.jpg        &gt;

         read online &lt;http://list.carnegieendowment.org/t/724354/11330778/57218/0/        &gt;

 Policy Recommendations:

 •       Eliminate exemptions. Fewer than three million of Pakistan's 175 million citizens pay any income tax, and the

 country's tax-to-GDP ratio is just 9 percent. By eliminating tax exemptions for the rich, politicians can fund essential
 social services.

 •        Increase tax revenue. Pakistani legislators must build a consensus to tax the rich and elite if they want to match
 growth rates in nearby developing countries.

 •        Spend more on development. Pakistan has spent twice as much on defense during peacetime as it has on
 education and health combined—this needs to change.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780139 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

        Stop the bailouts: Donor countries must put conditions on funding and should emphasize tax and economic

reform to help Pakistan develop long-term economic plans for sustainable growth.

"Pakistan's lack of a proper tax and revenue regime has resulted in high rates of tax evasion, burdening the country with

unsustainable debt and undermining its development priorities," writes Zaidi. "The key to the country's economic
prosperity—even its survival—is a far-reaching program of tax reform."

P proposing you put out the below based on bombing in Iran today. Thoughts?

For Immediate Release September 22, 2010

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

Explosion in Mahabad, Iran

I condemn the bombing targeting Iranians attending a parade in Mahabad today. The United States deplores this
senseless loss of life and extends its sympathy to the families and loved ones of those injured and killed. We also call for

the perpetrators of this horrific attack to be held accountable for their actions.

The United States condemns terrorism and all forms violence against innocent people, wherever it occurs, and stands
with the victims of these appalling acts. This attack underscores the global community's need to work together to

combat terrorist organizations that threaten the lives of innocent civilians all around the world.

Does Thomas Friedman Have to Talk to "Senior Economic Policy Makers" to Get So Many Things Wrong?

Thomas Friedman begins his piece today &lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/18/opinion/13friedman.html?hp              &gt; by
telling readers that: "over the past few weeks I've had a chance to speak with senior economic policy makers in America

and Germany." This might lead readers to believe that he is about to share some great insights that would only be
 possible for someone with special access to these senior economic policy makers.

 Readers with this expectation will be seriously disappointed. There is nothing here that is more insightful than what can
 be found on the Washington Post's editorial pages on an average workday. Friedman rehashes the usual cliches, with

the usual lack of thought. In doing so, he gets both the story of the recent past and the present seriously wrong.
Starting with the past, he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle:

"we've just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China to give
ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-term investments in new

growth engines."

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776272 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

 The main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part due to the

 fact that China lent to us. China's lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order to maintain its
 export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade, the Clinton administration had also tried to promote an

over-valued dollar.) The over-valued U.S. dollar made imports from China and other countries very cheap in the United

States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a large and growing trade deficit over most of the
 business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand, preventing the economy from approaching normal levels of

employment (even with the boost from the housing bubble) until just before the crash.
There is no reason whatsoever to believe that China's decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected by the Bush

tax cuts. In other words, neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to do with our borrowing
from China. The issue was China's decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Given the weakness of demand

 through most of the decade, these expenses could have been easily filled by domestic production without borrowing
from abroad.

Friedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. He refers to businesses' reluctance
to hire as the result of "unusual uncertainty," a phrase attributed to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke. Of

course there is no reluctance to hire, there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctance to hire would be reflected
in an increasing number of hours per worker, as employers sought to meet their demand for labor by working the

existing workforce more hours.
This is not happening. There is a modest uptick in hours from the low point of the downturn, but the increase in hours

per worker is certainly no more rapid than in other recessions and the average workweek is still far shorter in just about
every sector than it was before the downturn.

Later he tells readers:
"America's solvency inflection point is coinciding with a technological one. Thanks to Internet diffusion, the rise of cloud

computing, social networking and the shift from laptops and desktops to hand-held iPads and iPhones, technology is
destroying older, less skilled jobs that paid a decent wage at a faster pace than ever while spinning off more new skilled

jobs that pay a decent wage but require more education than ever."
This is a great story -- social networking is soaring, IPads are everywhere -- does Friedman have any evidence

whatsoever that this development has increased the demand for educated workers and reduced the demand for less
educated workers? If so, this would be the place in his column to present the evidence. Otherwise, readers might think

that the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for college grads (nearly triple the pre-recession level), coupled with a decline
in their real wages over the decade, implies a reduced demand for the labor of highly educated workers as well as less

educated workers.
Friedman's proposed fix also seems a bit wide of the mark. He insists:

"There is only one way to deal with this challenge: more innovation to stimulate new industries and jobs that can pay
workers $40 an hour, coupled with a huge initiative to train more Americans to win these jobs over their global

competitors. There is no other way."
We better hope there is another way. A wage of $40 an hour would put a worker well over the 90th percentile on the

wage distribution. Even if we double the number of jobs in this pay range -- an incredible accomplishment — what
happens to the other 80 percent of the workforce?

Friedman then warns us of the challenge from Europe by getting Germany's past and present wrong:
"Keeping up with Germany won't be easy. A decade ago Germany was the 'sick man of Europe. No more. The Germans

pulled together. Labor gave up wage hikes and allowed businesses to improve competitiveness and worker flexibility,
while the government subsidized firms to keep skilled workers on the job in the downturn."

Germany clearly has done some changes that benefited its economy, like work sharing, and some that haven't, but its
past as the "sick man of Europe" is an invention of Friedman or his highly placed sources. Germany always ran a trade

surplus. That is the most basic measure of a country's competitiveness: foreigners are buying its goods. Germany's
unemployment rate in 2000 averaged 7.5 percent &lt;http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?quervid=23071          &gt;, not hugely

different than its current 7.0 percent rate.
The story here is that Friedman seems to have completely missed the basics of the current economic crisis in spite of his

weeks of conversing with senior economic policy makers. The current crisis is due to a lack of demand pure and simple.
If we generate demand either through more expansionary Fed monetary policy, greater fiscal stimulus, or increased

exports due to a falling dollar, there is no reason to believe that the economy will not return to high levels of
employment. Certainly Friedman has presented no evidence that increased demand will not generate increased

employment as it always has.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776272 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

The longer term debt problem is overwhelmingly a health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedman's sources don't have
access to documents like the Medicare trustees report, which imply that U.S. health care costs will be controlled and

there will be no serious long-term deficit problem. This may prove wrong, but it seems that it would have at least been
worth noting in his column. Of course, if we have not fixed our health care system, we can always achieve huge saving

by relying on the more efficient health care systems in other countries

&lt;http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/free-trade-health-care&gt; .
If Friedman's intention was to scare us, he succeeded. After all, if senior economic policy makers in the U.S. and

Germany are as badly misinformed as Friedman implies, then we can expect some very bad times ahead.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

15th Anniversary of Srebrenica Genocide

Today we remember the tragic events in Srebrenica fifteen years ago. I join President Obama and the people of the

United States in offering our deepest condolences on this most solemn occasion. We honor the memories of the victims
and mourn with their families.

The United States stands with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all countries in the region who wish to foster peace and

reconciliation. We remain committed to ensuring that those responsible for these crimes face justice. We recognize that
there can be no lasting peace without justice. It is only by bringing all responsible parties to account for their crimes that

we will truly honor Srebrenica's victims.

We are duty-bound — to the victims, to their surviving family members, and to future generations — to prevent such
atrocities from happening again. Our common faith in the value of freedom and peace unifies us and drives us to act.

That is why we are committed to working with all the communities that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina to move
forward and build a pluralistic, democratic state that can take its rightful place in the Euro-Atlantic community. A

prosperous, free, and unified Bosnia and Herzegovina is the most worthy monument to those who lost their lives at
Srebrenica and the best guarantee against such a tragedy ever repeating itself.

A few quick things:

1.    Mexico. Looks like we are headed (cross your fingers) for a resolution on the transboundary issue. The park is still
up in the air, though we may get there. 	                                                                                          B5

2.    Posner/Fox. Pi went on Fox this morning to push back on the Posner statements. They were blown out of
proportion	                           I've pasted them at the bottom of this email. 	                                                B5

3.    Ecuador. Are you still inclined to think about going? I think Huma will discuss with you. I'm intrigued by the
possibility of you giving your major speech in Ecuador.

4.    Pakistan. Paul and his team made one recommendation, which I passed on to Matt. I can fill you in tomorrow.

POSNER excerpt:

QUESTION: Was there any areas in which China sort of turned the tables and raised its own complaints or concerns

about U.S. practices around the globe or at home? Can you give some examples there —

ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Sure. You know, I think — again, this goes back to Ambassador Huntsman's comment.

Part of a mature relationship is that you have an open discussion where you not only raise the other guy's problems, but
you raise your own, and you have a discussion about it. We did plenty of that. We had experts from the U.S. side, for
example, yesterday, talking about treatment of Muslim Americans in an immigration context. We had a discussion of

racial discrimination. We had a back-and-forth about how each of our societies are dealing with those sorts of
questions. So, throughout the day yesterday and again today, we had a discussion about the relationship of food safety,

law, human rights today. Food safety is an issue, as our experts told us this afternoon, a big issue in the United States.
And it's an issue in China. And in some cases, we're talking about the same thing. We had a discussion yesterday about
labor inspections. Well, it turns out that there aren't enough labor inspectors in factories, either in China or the United

States. Maybe that's something we can work on together. So, I think the tone of the discussions was very much not
"We've got all the answers; we're telling the Chinese how to behave." It was framed in an international context,
international standards. We're both obligated. And let's talk about things that we're both dealing with, and try to figure

out — can we help each other? And where we have differences, how do we mitigate those differences? Yeah.

QUESTION: It's a follow-up about the (inaudible) case. Did you (inaudible) about immediate release to Chinese

(inaudible)?

ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: I'm not going to get into the details. We've expressed in the past our concern about

the nature of the detention, and we certainly continue to be concerned about the fact that he's in prison. Yes.

QUESTION: Did the recently passed Arizona immigration law come up? And, if so, did they bring it up or did you bring it

up?

ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: We brought it up early and often. It was mentioned in the first session, and as a

troubling trend in our society and an indication that we have to deal with issues of discrimination or potential
discrimination, and that these are issues very much being debated in our own society.

QUESTION: Did they bring it — did they discuss anything about their concerns about Chinese visiting in Arizona, any
concerns raised —

ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: No, that was not raised.

Comments from Ros-Lehtinen re recess appointment of Ford:

"During the past two years, Syria has continued to sponsor violent extremism and pursue dangerous weapons programs,

and has also supplied long-range missiles to Hezbollah and reasserted its destabilizing influence in Lebanon at the
expense of that nation's sovereignty. Making undeserved concessions to Syria tells the regime in Damascus that it can
continue to pursue its dangerous agenda and not face any consequences from the U.S. That is the wrong message to be

sending to a regime which continues to harm and threaten U.S. interests and those of such critical allies as Israel."

I can do this. Could definitely use support — from Jonathan if possible — since food security is not my specialty. Two
things I think. First, some non-voluminous background so I can be literate and informed about the whole topic, and
especially the climate intersection. And then help with talking points once we get clarity on what I should be prepared

to talk about. Jonathan — is that doable? Not exactly in the lane for my team, so some assistance would be great. Let
me know if this sounds doable. Thx

Dear Todd,

I am following up on our conversation this morning. I wanted to see if you could possibly arrange your schedule to represent
the U.S. Government at a conference Prince Charles is hosting in London on February 28. The Secretary wants to make sure

that we are appropriately represented.

Essentially, the Prince of Wales wants to do for the food security and natural capital debate what his earlier convening did for

REDD (i.e., by contributing to the Oslo-Paris process and thereby to REDD financing breakthroughs). He is hoping that
economic analysis of the costs of food insecurity driven by climate change, water, and energy impacts will help governments

design more resilient development pathways. He is also hopeful that this work will feed into Rio+20 and the G20.

The conference looks like a good chance for us to keep the momentum going on the agriculture-and-climate track launched at
Durban and for us more generally to connect with some of our regular climate change contacts (confirmed attendees listed
below). Because of the level of attendance from other countries, we need someone of your rank to represent the United

States.

Our interagency food security team can will obviously need to take up some of this work as it moves forward. If you are able
to attend, Jonathan Shrier and his food security team can help with your preparations. See attendees below.

Best.

I agree on Todd as candidate.

I can call Claudia to check on level of other attendees. I know her well from her time as OES

A/S, and she mentioned this new interest of Prince Charles when she stopped by to see me last
fall in her new role with the his foundation.

 Prince Charles is convening a meeting to discuss "how an economic analysis of food security
 risks, taking full account of the instability caused by the undermining of natural capital
[water, energy, etc], would help governments design more resilient development pathways." He
 is modeling this on a process that he convened related to quantifying the costs of REDD

(Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) that contributed to the Oslo-
 Paris process and REDD financing. He hopes that a similar economic analysis of food
 insecurity will be carried forward by an informal working group launched at this Feb 28th
 meeting, which would then hopefully be considered by Rio+20 and the G20.

 Would be good to know what other ministers and reps are attending. This does sound like an
 interesting process (esp if it can have the impact REDD analysis did) and we could try to
 send higher level to a follow-up event in the Rio+20/G20 lead up. Todd might be a good

 candidate.

       me to forward a letter from him to Secretary Clinton. My apologies for bothering you with

       this, but the last round of correspondence somehow got lost in the Department for several

                                            Threatening to Burn Quran

The Union Home Minister Slui P.Chidambaram has appealed to media to help maintain communal peace and
harmony in the wake of reports of a pastor in the United States threatening to burn the holy Quran. In a
statement issued here today, the Union Home Minister said that the act is calculated to increase strife between

different religious groups. Following is the text of his statement :

"There are reports of a pastor in the United States threatening to burn the Quran on September 11, 2010.

The US authorities have strongly condemned the statement of the pastor. Religious leaders all over the world
 have also condemned his proposed action.

 We condemn the action of the pastor. It is totally unbecoming of anyone who claims to be a man of religion. It
 is obviously calculated to increase bitterness and strife between different religious groups. No one who is
 interested in maintaining harmony and peace among different sections of the people can condone such action.

 We hope that the US authorities will take strong action to prevent such an outrage being committed.
 While we await the action of the US authorities, we would appeal to the media in India — both print and

 visual media — to refrain from telecasting visuals or publishing photographs of the deplorable act. We
 would also appeal to the media to exercise great restraint over the next couple of days and help in
 maintaining communal peace and harmony."

India Condemns U.S. Pastor's Plan to Burn the Quran, Urges

Media Restraint

By Bibhudatta Pradhan - Sep 9, 2010

India "condemns" a plan by a Florida pastor to burn copies of the Koran and the government hopes the U.S. will
take strong action against him, Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in New Delhi.

Terry Jones, pastor of the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville has been criticized by U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton and the Vatican for his plan to burn the Muslim holy book on Sept. 11. General David
Petraeus, commander of international coalition forces in Afghanistan, said the act would endanger U.S. troops.

Chidambaram urged Indian newspapers not to publish photographs of what he said would be a "deplorable act"
and asked television channels to refrain from broadcasting images. The media must show restraint over the
"next couple of days and help in maintaining communal peace and harmony," the minister said, reading a

government statement.

The proposed burning "is totally unbecoming of anyone who claims to be a man of religion," Chidambaram
said. About 13 percent of India's 1.2 billion people are Muslim.

Facing mounting criticism around the world and at home, Jones said yesterday that supporters have sent him
copies of the Koran to burn and he was not convinced "that backing down is the right thing to do," Associated
Press reported.

</span>

Dear Cheryl—

In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the

recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other
 NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those

organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of
Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the

Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In
addition, we recommended inviting Monserior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in

 Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the
 Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.

 While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,

 who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free
 trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human

 rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the
 equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the

 counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the
 country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on

 U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to
 increased coca production.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775057 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some
important improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without

repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a "great hero"
&lt;http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754         &gt; and failed even to mention any concerns.

These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public
acknowledgement — some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current

government and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:

      A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called "false positives": non-

combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes
&lt;http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia     &gt; UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,

"began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004." Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston
indicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's
presidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story

of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.

The prosecution of "false positives" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case —the

murders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb of Soacha — nearly all of the accused soldiers and
officers have been released from prison &lt;http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968           &gt;, pending trial, as
deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by

numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as
"acts of service." Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high
as 98.5 percent.

      Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service
&lt;http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123     &gt; of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate

&lt;http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752&gt; Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights
defenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears &lt;http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1467           &gt; against political

opponents.

 Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and "political warfare" came

from high up in the Colombian presidency &lt;http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-
de-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales   &gt; , though the question of "what President Uribe knew, and when he knew
 it" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.

 •     President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as "para-politics." This
 coalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to

 narcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that
 killed tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.

 Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,
 governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common
 cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68

 &lt;http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64      &gt; are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for
 paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former

 foreign minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican
 Republic, and Canada.

 The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth
 about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775057 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

from a public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate
and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.

At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between

the first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.
Though President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of
success in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage

to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one
candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.

Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of
Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be
most unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez

rhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.

Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful

materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.

Very best wishes —

On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

Dear Cheryl—

In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of

the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the
recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other

NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those
organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of

Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the
Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In

addition, we recommended inviting Monsefior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in
Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the

Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.

While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,
who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free

trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human
rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the

equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the
counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the

country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on

U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to
increased coca production.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775063 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some

important improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without
repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a "great hero"
&lt;http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754&gt; and failed even to mention any concerns.

These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public
acknowledgement some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current

government and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:

      Asharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called "false positives": non-
combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes
&lt;http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia    &gt; UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,

"began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from2004." Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston
indicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's
presidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story

of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.

The prosecution of "false positives" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case —the

murders of about twenty young men fromthe poor Bogota suburb of Soacha —nearly all of the accused soldiers and
officers have been released from prison &lt;http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968&gt;, pending trial, as
deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by

numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court systemas
"acts of service." Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high
as 98.5 percent.

      Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service
&lt;http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123    &gt; of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used  to spy on and intimidate

&lt;http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752&gt; Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights
defenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears &lt;http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1467          &gt; against political
opponents.

Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and "political warfare" came
from high up in the Colombian presidency &lt;http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-

de-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales&gt; , though the question of "what President Uribe knew, and when he knew
it" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reformor dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.

      President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as "para-politics." This
coalition has included dozens of political bosses fromregions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to
narcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that

killed tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.

 Evidence, much of it fromformer paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,

governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of themAlvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common
 cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68
 &lt;http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64&gt; are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for

 paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former
 foreign minister; and individuals whomthe President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican
 Republic, and Canada.

 The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth

 about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly
 froma public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate
 and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775063 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between
the first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.

Though President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of
success in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage
to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one

candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.

Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of

Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be
most unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez
rhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.

Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful

materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.

Very best wishes —

On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

Netanyahu pleased: I didn't capitulate

Ben Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here
&lt;http://www.scribd.com/doc/32038200/Maariv-May27-10-Netanyahu-Says-He-Beat-Obama&gt; and at bottom of post] In

the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration.

Netanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel
between him and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make

concessions on our red lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said
Netanyahu, according to people who heard him speak.

Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to
expire in September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the

administration that the Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories,
and the Americans will "make sure" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take

"aggressive" action and construction will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the
settlement blocs.

The Prime Minister's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. "The statements attributed to the prime minister are
incorrect," said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. "They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The

reason is simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the
commitment by President Obama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace

process in our region."
Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week

might attest to a radical change in the White House's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the
planned meeting as "the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama

administration in the past number of weeks." The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave
crisis that erupted some two months ago between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian

conflict and particularly over the continued construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that
was received as if Israel was "no longer an absolute ally of the United States."

That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire
among members of the Obama administration to rectify the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to

end the crisis is the fear of failure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. "The Democratic Party's coffers
are empty. Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to

 continue, they would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections," said one source in
 Washington.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774925 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

The prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two
months ago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture

taken together and to give statements to the media.
That said, sources in Washington noted that "Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap

once again. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very
difficult questions, like 'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians."
Netanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel's

acceptance into the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his
movement through the city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.

Challenges From Iran to North Korea Spotlight

Old Threats

By Indira A.R. Lakshmanan and John Walcott - Apr 12, 2012 8:30 PM ETFri Apr 13 00:30:00 GMT 2012

For a decade, the world's attention has been drawn to what U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clintoncalls

"new actors" on the international stage. This week, world leaders have been preoccupied by a problem as

old as geopolitics: bad actors.

The U.S. and its allies failed to dissuade North Korea from testing a long-range rocket, and are struggling

to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and Syria from killing its own people to quell dissent.

The U.S. and its allies failed to dissuade North Korea from testing a long-range rocket.

Clinton's former policy planning chief Anne-Marie Slaughter said, "For all the emphasis on the new world, no one should

forget it's on top of, not instead of, old problems."

 "The old world and the  .new world coexist," said Anne- Marie Slaughter, Clinton's former policy planning

 chief. "For all the emphasis on the new world, no one should forget it's on top of, not instead of, old
 problems."

 In daily meetings at the State Department, Slaughter said she spent half the time on immediate crises and

 half on emerging transnational threats to global stability, such as food securityand climate change.    Many

 of the crises are throwbacks to"Kissinger's world," she said, referring to President Richard Nixon's

 secretary of state Henry Kissinger.

 The latest flurry of diplomacy and pressure to rein in Iran, North Korea and Syria -- countries that have
 repeatedly challenged global norms over the last three decades -- also underscores that there are limited

 alternatives to address the age-old problem of rogue nations.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05796089 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

"It's really hard to address these issues decisively when you've only got diplomatic and economic tools,
particularly when the nuclear card is in play," Slaughter, a professor atPrinceton University, said in an

interview. "You're applying a lot of pressure to an entity that, in the end, is able to hunker down and say

'no.' If you're not going to address it militarily, what else can you do?"

Policeman of the World

Slaughter and other supporters of the administration's foreign policy give President Barack Obama credit
for building multilateral coalitions to pressure Iran, North Korea and Syria through negotiations and

sanctions, rather than taking unilateral military action.

"The U.S. is no longer accepted as the policeman of the world and to try to be one is counterproductive,"
said Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as national security adviser to PresidentJimmy Carter. Multinational

pressure on rogue states is essential, he said, even if getting to a solution that way may be gradual, painful

and slow.

"Without large-scale international consensus, efforts by the United States are going to make things worse,"

 Brzezinski said in an interview. "Before plunging headfirst into Syria or giving a green light to Israel to

 attack Iran, we have to think through what are the likely consequences of dealing with problems of past in
 a manner reminiscent of the past."

 `Geometry' .of Power

 Speaking this week at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis,Maryland, Clinton said that "while the

 geometry of global power may have changed, American leadership is as essential as ever."

 Clinton consistently has advocated multilateral diplomacy as the solution to both old and new problems.

 The U.S. "must reflect the world as it is, not as it used to be. It does not make sense to adapt a 19th century

 concert of powers or a loth century balance of power strategy. We cannot go back to Cold War

 containment or to unilateralism," she said in a July 2009 speech at the Council on Foreign Relations
 inWashington.

 In the same speech, she stressed the need to "multi-task"to address traditional and 21st century threats.

 "We have to deal with the urgent, the important, and the long-term all at once," Clinton said.

 `Witches Brew'

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05796089 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

After the end of the Cold War, some foreign policy pundits popularized the idea that new transnational
threats -- extremist ideologies and terrorism, battles over natural resources, climate change, food security,

pandemics -- had supplanted traditional geopolitical conflicts.

"The way we talked about these problems in the '90s was that a witches' brew of civil war, state weakness,

genocide, disease, refugees and spillover effects would metastasize into some kind of contagion that could
really affect global stability," recalled Michael O'Hanlon, a scholar at theBrookings Institution in

Washington and co-author of "Bending History: Barack Obama's Foreign Policy."

This week's trio of crises are a "stark reminder that some traditional threats remain," O'Hanlon said.
"We're still half in Machiavelli's world, but half in the world" of dangerous hackers, terrorists and melting

icecaps.

Obama deserves credit for "dealing with the inbox as it arrived," O'Hanlon said. "He prioritized and
handled the classic threats, as well as the 21st century threats he couldn't ignore: namely terrorism."

 Emerging Threats

 Walter Russell Mead, a professor at Bard College in upstateNew    York, said some so-called emerging
 threats, such as the imminent threat of a war over water, may have been"overblown." Meanwhile, trying to

 rein in Iran's suspected ambitions to acquire nuclear weapons capability and dissuade North Korea from

 missile and nuclear development is a challenge that "presidents going back to George H.W. Bush have
 been trying to address without a lot of success."

 There are "transnational forces out there, but states remain very important," said Eliot Cohen, who was

 chief foreign policy adviser to Condoleezza Rice when she was President George W. Bush's secretary of
 state. "We're not as far from the world of Clausewitz as some pundits would like to think," he said in an

 interview, referring to the 19th century German military theorist Carl von Clausewitz.

 While some academics and columnists promoted the notion that traditional interstate rivalries were
 obsolete, policy makers always understood that "these problems are still very much with us," said Cohen,

 now a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.

 Many Problems at Once

 "The challenge for American foreign policy is you have many different problems at once -- al Qaeda, the
 radical Islamist threat, the generic problem of ungoverned states," as well as problem nations such as

 North Korea and Iran, and big powers such as China and     Russia  "that aren't necessarily well disposed to
 the U.S.," he said.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05796089 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

Brian Katulis, a fellow at the Center for American Progress in Washington, said the last decade also

demonstrated the flaws in some strategies promoted to address emerging crises.

"From 2007 'till 2011, we had a fixation with counterinsurgency strategy, when it was quite clear it
delivered mixed results in Iraq and  Afghanistan," he said. "It was very costly for U.S. taxpayers and has

not produced sustainable results."

Slaughter noted that new threats, such as nuclear proliferation, and old threats, such as rogue states,

intersect in ways that make them very difficult to address. North Korea has sold nuclear technology and
been involved in transnational criminal networks, while Iran has supported terrorism and proliferated

weapons.

With Iran, North Korea and    Syriathis week, the attention is on "traditional chessboard geopolitics: they

move, we move, and what do we have that can try to force them to change their behavior," she said.

"Kissinger's world is still there."

Dear Clinton, Jones, and Summers: Five Step Improvement Plan

for U.S. Development

July 15, 2010

By Nancy Birdsall

Six months after the Haiti quake, many people are frustrated that the U.S.-led relief and reconstruction effort has not

made more rapid progress. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and USAID Administrator Raj Shah are

headed for Pakistan, where the strategic stakes are larger, development challenges even more complicated, and
U.S. policy muddled at best. Eighteen months into the administration, the federal government remains abysmally

organized to address Haiti, Pakistan and other development challenges. When it comes to global development, I'd

give President Obama and his top advisors an A for strategic vision and a big fat F for failure to get on with it.

 Hillary Clinton gave a great speech  about development way back in January, pegged to the appointment (finally) of

a new head of USAID. A draft presidential study directive leaked two months ago said all the right things

(development is about trade, climate and migration policy not just aid and the U.S. government should eschew doing

everything in favor of what it can do especially well). But objections presumably from the State Department about

the proposed "architecture" (who is in charge of what) are apparently stalling its release — to the point where the
 passage of time risks making it irrelevant. The White House incorporated the good vision in the leaked PSD into a

 press release on "a new approach to advancing development"          issued at the G8 — so between Secretary Clinton

and the White House strategy: An A for vision.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770484 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

What about getting on with it? On the aid side the MCC has landed on its feet, though is pathetically underfunded

with a budget of $1.105 billion (USAID directly managed about $17 billion last year–closer to $25 billion if you

included shared USAID/State resources–and PEPFAR's budget was about $7 billion). The administration has

launched two big new initiatives — for  food security and global health, but I can't figure outwho's in charge of

those. The USAID administrator still has no senior staff appointed.    A big effort to spend aid money well in
             vulnerable to staffing problems and the counter-bureaucracy former USAID administrator Natsios
Pakistan is
decries.  Moreover it is not clear that anyone near Ambassador Richard Holbrooke (who seems to be in charge of

the Pakistan effort) is in a position to make operational the well-defined development objectives in theerry-Lugar

legislation which is funding the five-year $7.5 billion Pakistan aid program. So I fearhat short-term diplomatic

and security diversions   will dominate long-term development investments.

On the Hill,draft legislation for a Global Partnership Act   is being circulated by congressional staff, aiming to

replace the outdated 1961 Foreign   Assistance Act. That's good. But it has been in the works for several years, and

without a push from the executive branch will it get the priority it deserves anytime soon?

It's embarrassing when the Europeans and the Japanese ask us to explain who's who and what's what on

development in the no-longer-new Obama Administration.

We need leadership from Secretary Clinton at State and from Jim Jones and Larry Summers of the National

Security and National Economic Councils in the White House. Here's a practical agenda for how to move beyond

planning and visioning and get on it.

It's built around a straightforward idea: tum the neglected and abused USAID into the "premier development

agency" Hillary Clinton promised U.S. taxpayers in her speech last January. (Our hopscotch board illustration sums

these up!)

1.    Now: Give the USAID administrator    policy

authority  to inform and influence development issues
within the State Department. Ensure he has visibility

 to shore up his political standing. He should be the

 spokesperson on Haiti,  Feed the Future and on

 development programs in Pakistan, Afghanistan,

 Yemen and other strategically critical states.

 2.    Now: Give the USAID administrator   budget

 authority, because without control over resources, policy input will have little real influence.

 3.    Now: Create an  interagency development policy group chaired by the Secretary of State         with the USAID

 administrator as the vice chair and with aseat on the National Security Council.    The USAID administrator should

 sit and have a voice at the table where trade, climate, and immigration decisions are discussed. Same for currency
 policy with China, intellectual property tensions with India, and a host of other issues that impact development where

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770484 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

it is crucial that decisions take into account the long-term U.S. interest in supporting the growth of viable and

responsible states in the developing world.

4.    By the end of 2011: Make USAID an independent agency, like the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the

MCC, with a board chaired by the Secretary of State to ensure coherence with overall foreign policy

objectives. Make the USAID administrator      the chair of the inter-agency development policy group.

5.    By the end of the president's current term: Ask Congress to create a cabinet-level agency for development,

with a cabinet secretary of equal standing with his or her counterparts in the foreign policy troika of

defense, diplomacy and development. Move (yes, really) the responsibility for the multilateral banks (but not the

IMF) out of Treasury to this cabinet agency, as we recommended six years ago in our report "On the Brink: Weak

States and U.S. National Security."

But (you might be thinking) this is all about process and not about action. Why do these "process" steps

matter? First, accountability. Disorganization at the federal level is stalling action. Someone and some agency

must be in charge and accountable to the Congress and the taxpayers for development dollars and programs.
Second, as clear in the president's statements, development is about more than aid, and someone in the

administration must have a mandate to promote smart development-friendly policies       in inter-agency decision-

making. Third, smart development policy and programs are built on learning and feedback from the field. It makes

no sense to have "strategy" designed and adjusted in Washington without input from operations – and it's the

professionals managing our aid programs who have those insights.

The draft legislation  from House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman takes the first two steps,

creates an interagency development policy committee and leaves open to the administration whether it would be
chaired by the Secretary of State or USAID administrator. Yet already there are  reports that the State Department

sees this as an unacceptable encroachment, rather than as a way to boost USAID as the premiere development

agency (an agency that would still report to the Secretary of State). I continue to believe the a single cabinet-level

agency for development—like the UK's Department for International Development—would be the clearest signal that

development is on par with diplomacy and defense in our national security arsenal. But we could still make great

strides in that direction even if we don't make it all the way to a cabinet agency.

Development policy and programs are a key input to a central foreign policy goal of the United States: building and

supporting capable states around the world that address the needs of their own people and play by the global rules
of the game. The Obama administration needs to get on with it and take the first step—or hop—towards 21st

century development.

An afterthought: Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew is leaving State–where he held much of the big budget

authority that belongs in an autonomous USAID–to become the      new head of OMB.     His departure creates an

 opening for Secretary Clinton to take the first hops illustrated above.

   Kerry, Lugar Amendment To Restore Full Funding To President Obama's

                                    International Affairs Budget

Washington, DC – Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, on the Senate floor today

introduced an amendment to restore four billion dollars in cuts to the President's international affairs budget.

The senator's full remarks as prepared are below:

If the first years of the twenty-first century have taught us anything about national security, it is that in a
globalized world, our problems are interconnected, and so—ultimately—is our security. We are endangered by

weak and failed states as well as by strong states. We are endangered by diseases and climate change emissions
half a world away. We are endangered when we allow chaos and crisis to create the conditions for ideologies of
radical hatred and violence to take root. And it is clear to all that meeting these global challenges will require
far more than our military: it will require a strengthened commitment to diplomacy and development.

To put this as simply and bluntly as possible, that's why passing a robust foreign affairs budget is a matter not

just of America's world leadership, but also of our national security. But don't take my word for it:

Ask our Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates. He said: "What is clear to me is that there is a need for a dramatic
increase in spending on the civilian instruments of national security – diplomacy, strategic communications,
 foreign assistance, civic action, and economic reconstruction and development."

         Secretary of State and former colleague, Hillary Clinton, who testified in her confirmation hearing that
 Ask our
"the relatively small but important amount of money we do spend on foreign aid is in the best interests of the
 American people" and "promotes our national security and advances our interests and reflects our values."

 When our soldiers and generals join our top diplomats in demanding increased civilian capacity and increased
 civilian funding—even in the midst of an economic crisis— that's when you know there is not just a growing
 consensus, but a real sense of urgency behind strengthening our civilian mission.

 Returning diplomacy and development to their rightful place cannot be achieved through words alone: It takes
 money to drive civilian foreign policy—and if it keeps us safer, as I believe it will, then that is money well
 spent.

 Full funding of the President's international affairs budget is a vital step toward greater civilian capacity, and I

 urge my colleagues to support it. That's why, along with Senators Lugar, Leahy, Voinovich, Durbin, Kaufman,
 Menendez, Dodd, Feinstein, Brown, Sanders, Lieberman, Casey, and Corker, I ask for approval of this
 amendment to restore $4 billion worth of funding to the President's FY 2010 international affairs budget request
 for the Function 150 Account. The offset here will come from the Function 920 Account.

 The reality is that right now, we are not doing nearly enough to invest in diplomacy and development. That's

 the finding of numerous studies conducted inside and outside of government. Funding for the Department of
 Defense is over half a trillion dollars. In 2008, the Army added about 7,000 soldiers to its total; that's more
 people than serve in the entire American Foreign Service. 1,100 Foreign Service officers could be hired for the
 cost of a single C-17 military cargo plane. And four billion dollars is less than two percent of what the
 government has given to AIG.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760665 Date: 06/30/2015</span>

That is vital context for any discussion of the President's proposed increase in the international affairs
budget. The President requested $53.8 billion in FY 2010 to fund next year's budget—an increase of 8%, or $4
billion, over last year's funding level of $49.8 billion.

We must recognize just what a small share of our overall spending the President's international affairs budget

comprises: 1.4% of the total FY 2010 Budget and only 6.8% of the "national security budget," which includes
defense and homeland security. Even with this year's proposed increase in funding, the international affairs
budget still represents just 0.35% of GDP. This sliver of our budget funds all State Department operations,
foreign aid and foreign policy programs, our diplomatic programs, global health initiatives on HIV/AIDS,
Malaria and Tuberculosis programs, and humanitarian assistance to help stabilize fragile states, reduce global
poverty and assist refugees.

 Some have described the President's request as a 41% increase from last year's budget of $38 billion, but that
simply isn't accurate: The figure of $38 billion doesn't include last year's supplemental appropriations, which
raise the total to nearly $50 billion. The President's FY 2010 budget includes supplemental
appropriations. That's why the actual increase is only $4 billion, or 8%. When we talk about changes in

spending, we have to compare apples to apples.

What's more, the President should be commended for following through on his pledge to enhance transparency
and improve fiscal discipline by shifting supplemental appropriations into a single budget. This is a more
straightforward way of doing business that doesn't seek to hide or massage spending figures by tucking extra
spending into supplemental bills. That is why my colleague Senator Conrad, the Chairman of the Budget

Committee, has been vocal in praising this new approach.

But the real question we are facing today is what will this extra $4 billion get us? This $4 billion will bring
vital foreign aid increases to programs in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This $4 billion will build civilian capacity
and put our diplomats back on the front lines of American foreign policy. This $4 billion will provide life

saving treatment for people with HIV/AIDS and supports broad prevention efforts that save lives every
day. This $4 billion will help make people all over the world safer, and in the process, it will help keep
America safer.
Of course, some will claim that in the midst of a global economic crisis, we do not have the luxury of leading on
the global stage. But this is precisely the moment when our investment is most needed—and it is also a
moment when our leadership and our economic system face the greatest challenge. And ultimately, efforts in

the developing world win us influence and respect, and they also contribute to the growth and stability of future
consumers of our products and future trading partners.

There is scarcely a corner of the globe where our efforts are not impacted by this budget:

In Afghanistan and Pakistan, we must finally reverse years of neglect and drift.

 Imagine a nation as populous as Iraq, Afghanistan and North Korea—combined. A nation with a full arsenal of
 nuclear weapons, and ballistic missiles capable of delivering them anywhere in a thousand- kilometer
 range. Imagine a nation whose population is overwhelmingly moderate, overwhelmingly committed to
 democracy and rule of law—but deeply suspicious of its leadership, and of America's friendship. Imagine a
 nation in which Osama bin Laden and the leadership of Al Qaeda has found sanctuary for the past seven

 years—a haven from which they and their confederates have plotted and carried out attacks on their host
 country, on neighboring countries, and on sites around the globe.

 This nation could serve the keystone for a new, cooperative relationship between the Western and Muslim
 worlds—or become an epicenter for radicalism and violence on a cataclysmic scale. Now imagine that

                                                          17

         <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760665 Date: 06/30/2015</span>

  America took a long, hard look at the status quo of our policy towards a nation at just such a crossroads—and
  decided to do nothing different.

• We need a bold, new strategy for Pakistan: Our current path has not brought success, and simply tinkering
  around the margins is guaranteed to fail. We have little choice but to think big. That is why President Obama
  called on Congress to pass the Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act that Sen. Lugar and I will introduce

  very soon: It will authorize $1.5 billion annually, in order to help shape a new relationship with
  Pakistan. Without the full authorization of the President's budget, even a priority as vital as this one could be
  shunted aside.

  We are not the only ones vying for influence. You know who else understands clearly how powerful a weapon
  foreign aid can be? Iran does. That's why after its proxy Hezbollah provoked Israel's bombing of Lebanon,

  they painted the green Hezbollah flag on houses all over Lebanon—houses they plan to rebuild, largely with
  Iranian money. If we don't spend money on aid, we are surrendering the field to those who do.

  Nor can we afford to abandon our efforts against global AIDS. We know that PEPFAR has won America
   friends and allies across Africa and the world we know that AIDS contributes to failed states, not to mention
   incalculable human misery amongst the sick and dying and the orphans they leave behind—and that is why our

  national interest and our moral interest demand that we deliver on our commitments at a moment of
  crisis. Last year, both parties came together to authorize up to $48 billion over five years. Today, it is
   imperative that we do all we can to fund these programs. If we don't, we will freeze enrollment of patients into
   life-saving antiretroviral treatment. Meanwhile, prevention efforts –the most cost-effective way to stop AIDS
   from ravaging a society—will be the first ones cut. And tragically, we know what will happen next: more
   people will contract HIV, and more will die from AIDS-related illnesses.

   Refugees and human rights advocates also need our help. Economic support funds are vital to support those
   living inside countries with repressive regimes, like Burma and Zimbabwe. We know that refugees and
   displaced populations can be the spark for large-scale violence, and today we face that very threat from the
   millions displaced from homes in Iraq. Our Migration and Refugee Assistance is more important than ever to
   help us provide immediate, effective assistance to these vulnerable populations.

   Our international affairs budget will also have profound implications for another national security issue that will
   only grow in importance: the threat of global climate change. This December, the global community will be
   meeting in Copenhagen to create a new international agreement to address the urgent threat of global climate
   change. The science is screaming at us: we have no time to lose if we hope to avert catastrophe. If we want to
   persuade the developing nations of the world to do what is necessary and in all of our interests— we must help
   them to respond now to the impacts of the crisis that are already being felt globally—and to preemptively make

   the dramatic technological changes across their economies that this threat demands.

   Our leverage at the negotiating table in Copenhagen will depend directly on our ability to offer a strong
   financing package. Negotiators are meeting for an interim session this week in Bonn, and it is essential that we
   send a clear signal that the United States Congress is serious about financing to support the commitments the
   Obama Administration makes on the world stage—and serious about being part of the global solution to one of

   the greatest threats we face.

   We also need more diplomats and aid officers to troubleshoot on the front lines. The 2010 budget also marks
   the first year of a new commitment to a significant increase in the size of the Foreign Service at both the State
   Department and USAID. Today we are barely covering attrition rates. We have asked these agencies to
   expand their missions and operations into new theaters like Iraq and Afghanistan—and we need to expand their

   resources accordingly.

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760665 Date: 06/30/2015</span>

Even as we face long-term security threats such as climate change, we must also address the immediate and
urgent threats of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism. The President's budget provides additional

nonproliferation and counter-proliferation funding to secure nuclear materials around the world, and to fund
new and ongoing initiatives to build the counterterrorism capacity of partnering countries to do the
same. That's how you leverage our civilian spending to keep America safe.

Surveying the wide range of commitments and aspirations this budget addresses, it is clear that our challenge is
immense. And yet, even as we confront a crisis here at home, we cannot afford to delay the task of restoring our

leadership, returning to our best traditions of civilian outreach, and restoring our influence and authority. We
cannot afford to come up short on our promises to allies, to vulnerable populations, and to the world. We
cannot try to be a world leader on the cheap. If we fail to do our part to solve the world's problems, those

problems will eventually find us here at home.

From pandemics to climate change to failed states, this century's security challenges demand that a new level of

commitment to diplomacy and development. With this relatively small investment, we are making significant
strides toward restoring America's leadership role in the world. It will make the world safer, and it will make
us safer. And so I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the President's budget request.

                                                 ###

THE PRESIDING OFFICER: WHO YIELDS TIME IN OPPOSITION TO THE
             AMENDMENT?
             THE SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA.

             MR. CONRAD: MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN THE SENATOR APPROACHED ME ABOUT
             THIS YESTERDAY, I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS

             AMENDMENT. AND I TOLD HIM THAT BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN HARD TO
             PUT TOGETHER, AND WE'VE TRIED TO HAVE AN EQUAL SHARING OF
             SACRIFICE BETWEEN ALL OF THE SPENDING ELEMENTS OF A BUDGET.
             WE'VE TRIED TO DO IT WITH RESPECT TO DOMESTIC SPENDING, DEFENSE
             SPENDING. WE'VE TRIED TO DO IT WITH MANDATORY SPENDING. AND
             INTERNATIONAL IS A COMPONENT OF THE DISCRETIONARY SIDE OF THE
             BUDGET, SO WE THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY FAIR THAT THEY BE ASKED TO
             MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. NOW, WHEN I TOLD THE SENATOR YESTERDAY
             THAT I WOULD STRONGLY RESIST THIS AMENDMENT, I DID NOT KNOW, I
             WAS NOT AWARE THAT HE HAD AN OFFSET FOR THAT AM AMENDMENT, AND
             THAT DOES ALTER THE SITUATION. THAT MAKES IT MORE PALATABLE
             BECAUSE WE MAINTAIN THE SAME BOTTOM LINE. BUT IT DOES CONCERN
             ME THAT WE ARE UPSETTING THE BALANCE OF WHAT I THINK IS A FAIR

             DISTRIBUTION OF THE PAIN OF THE CUTBACKS THAT WE HAVE HAD TO
             MAKE. AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. I AM CONCERNED
             THAT, YOU KNOW, OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET ARE BEING ASKED TO
             TAKE REDUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT'S REQUEST AND NOW
             INTERNATIONAL WILL NOT. SO    I JUST WANT TO SAY, I FIND THAT
             TROUBLING. I UNDERSTAND ABSOLUTELY THE SUBSTANCE OF THE
             ARGUMENT THAT THE SENATOR IS MAKING, AND HE IS RIGHT TO MAKE
             IT. HE IS CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, BUT I DO
             HOPE THAT COLLEAGUES THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT KIND OF THE EQUITY
             OF THE BURDEN HERE. THE EQUITY OF THE BURDEN. THE SECOND THING
             I WANT TO SAY WITH RESPECT TO THIS AMENDMENT IS IT USES A 920
             OFFSET. AND WE CAME OUT OF THE COMMITTEE WITH ABOUT $7 BILLION

             IN SAVINGS IN 920. THAT'S GENERAL OVERHEAD OF ALL OF THE
             AGENCIES. IN OTHER WORDS, ITS A ACROSS THE BOARD -- IT'S ACROSS
             THE BOARD, GOES TO THEIR OVERHEAD ACCOUNTS AND COULD WE TAKE

                                                  19

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760665 Date: 06/30/2015</span>

        SOMEWHAT MORE IN 920?
        YES, BUT NOT MUCH MORE. BUT NOT MUCH MORE. WE CAME OUT OF THE
        COMMITTEE AT $7 BILLION. I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO STAY AT ABOUT $10

        BILLION IN 920. THIS WOULD TAKE US TO $11 BILLION. AND SO I'M
        TROUBLED BY THAT AS WELL. WITH THAT SAID, I DON'T -- I DON'T
        INTEND TO OPPOSE THIS AMENDMENT, BUT I DO FIND IT TROUBLING ON
        THOSE TWO GROUNDS. ONE, IT DOES AFFECT THE FAIRNESS OF THE

        DISTRIBUTION OF THE PAIN, IF YOU WILL, OF THE CUTBACKS WE'VE
        HAD TO MAKE. AND, NUMBER TWO, IT ADDS TO THE SECTION 920
        OFFSETS IN A WAY THAT, TO ME, TAKES IT A LITTLE PAST THE REALM

        OF WHAT'S REASONABLE. BUT WITH THAT SAID, I DON'T INTEND TO
        OPPOSE THIS AMENDMENT AND ASK COLLEAGUES TO VOTE AGAINST IT. I
        YIELD THE FLOOR.

     Evolving Diplomatic Eco-system and Bangladesh Foreign Policy: An Agenda for Action              Mr. Humayun Kabir
    The foreign policy of a nation is conducted through the institution of diplomacy. Obviously, any evolution in the diplomatic concepts, norms and practices affect the conduct of •
    foreign policy of nations. Bangladesh is no exception to this process. Rather, as a nation which is increasingly coming into global interface, understanding and appreciation of the
    dynamics of diplomacy is all the more relevant and urgent. Let us have a look at how the changing global environment is impacting on the evolution of diplomacy in general, and
                                how the formulation and implementation of our foreign policy is affected by this process.
   During the last few decades, the topographyion of diplomacy has experienced significant transformation. Several factors contributed to this process. Recent intensity
      of thick globalism has pushed deeper the flow of information, capital, manpower, data, images, goods and services. Such a process Isas produced a kind of paradigm shift in
    international relations wills corresponding change not only in content but also in the context of international politics and perception. With the emergence of competition state,.
     as articulated by Philip J. Cerny, where transnational powers are achieving salience through the exercise of power by many non-state actors, such a process has gained further
    momentum. Intense competition hasones storysell international community. Those who can successfully tell their stories in a credible fashion win the hearts
    and minds of people, who in turn can become their friends, consumers, investors, tourists and promoters. In the same vein, the concept of national interest is being redefined in the
    larger context of collaborativeasnst the traditional setting of conflict and war alone. Continuous process of empowerment of people around the world has added
                                          another new complexity to such a process of transformation.
    Some scholars argue that as a consStatese sovereignidentity has given way to multiple identities of sovereign people. A nation is now evaluated constantly;
    governthe network-based world is not only changing topography of sovereignty but also flattened the capacity of hierarchy based bureaucracy practically in all states.ption. Indeed,
      Proliferation of many new actors in international politics and diplomatic arena has reshaped the global list ofs, academics,
      business leaders, international journalists, social entrepreneurs, foundations, philanthropists, and even celebrities, among others. Internet is extensively used to disseminate
    messages, initiate dialogue, recruit new allies and friends, build network, and advocate a particular cause or issue. The development of complex international actors and network
    has affected the international hierarchy of power in a significant way with the spread of huge horizontal contacts all over the world. In a globalised world, public opinion matters
    mfor the governments to put 'spin' to overcome communication challenges. In January 2007, Klaus Schwab, Executive Chairman and founder President of the World Economicdifficult
   Forum observed, We are witnessing everywhere a changing power equation. Power is moving from center to the periphery. Vertical command and control structures are eroding

                             and are being replaced by horizontal networks of social communities and collaborative platforms..
    management, peace- making and peace building, public health, and migration, among others. These emerging challenges have practically dwarfed the rapacity of any single stater
                                      to handle them. Cooperation among nations has thus become necessary.
    Several consequences flow from this process of transfommtion First, as the global system is becoming more fluid and flexible in nature, and moving from multi-polarity to multi
    centric power structure in a foreign nation, is being acutely felt. Thus, diplomacy has become a multi layered and multi partner exercise, characterized by the active involvement ofe
     multiple actors, namely government, civil society organizations, think tanks, business associations, media, advocacy groups, church and mosques, celebrities, and even private
    persons with global outreach. Second, with multiplicity of actors participating in the policy process, including various Ministries and Departments of a nation alone, the relations
    between nations have thus willy nilly evolved from the phase of formal foreign policy interactions to a deeper phase of domestic interccamectedness, as evidenced in the European
   Usignificantly transformed from a distant actor to an active social player and catalyst The growing role of Diaspora communities has accelerated this trend. Fourth, the process of
     diplomacy has also become more inclusive. In semis of focus, economic diplomacy or management of resources has occupied the centre stage in diplomatic interactions among
    practically all nations, including the most developed and powerful ones. Advocacy and activism has given way to diplomatic protocol and formalism. With the threat of extremism
     and terrorism growing and the possibility of failure of state institutions intensifying in some states, diplomacy has moved from a role of passive observer to an active partner in
                            promoting basic values of justice, democracy, human rights and inclusive development, among others.
                                                        The New Hubs

      As for Bangladesh, several regional and global developments are noteworthy. The rise of China and India, which is often called AChindia, offers both opportunities and
     challenges for us. Already, they are our top import sources and could be major export destinations a few years down the line. ASEAN nations are yet another growth
    already valuable partners in our economic growth; they could be potential sources of inveshnent, technology and ke, the Middle Easternpan and South Korea are
    countries have become the new center of Sovereign Funds and Bangladesh could capitalize on it. Of course, for the foreseeable future they are likely to remain as destinations for
    our export of manpower.ted States and EU member states are major destinations fort and shrimp products; they could be markets for our potential
      high value items in the future as well. Russia rind other CIS nations could be source of technology and energy, and new export destinations for Bangladeshi products. Laths

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776994 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

       America and Africa are still not high on our agenda, but both of these continents oiler immense opportunities for Bangladesh; we urgently need to build our diplomatic bridges
     with them without any further delay. It is important to understand that in a globalized world physical distance matters less than psychological distance. Clearly, in the coming years

      economic diplomacy will occupy the centre stage in exploring new opportunities around the globe. Now the big question is how do these openings fit into our national priorities?

                                                                              Bangladesh Priorities and Challenges

       As Bangladesh strives to elevate itself to a middle income country, she will have to address several developmental challenges, which are closely interlinked Let us now have a
                            look at some of the important issues, which will demand constant attention from the policy makers in Bangladesh in the coming years.
        - Strengthen Democracy- One of major priorities of Bangladesh in the coming years would be to strengthen democratic norms and practices. Being a socially driven nation, a
          careful nurturing of democracy would be required in Bangladesh to meet the ever growing expectations of the people for good governance, justice, fairness, decency and

         accountability in public life on a sustained manner. Indeed, the people of Bangladesh overwhelmingly conveyed several messages during the 2008 elections, including their
     forceful rejection of any kind of extremism, in addition to restoring democracy and returning the 0Mahajot0 to power. Reading those messages in right context and responding to

     them with appropriate care, creativity and dignity would perhaps determine the future course of democracy in Bangladesh. In addition, Bangladesh could also project the verdict of
     2008 elections and subsequent forceful stand of the present government against religious extremism as a test case of how a Muslim majority nation could embrace democracy and
                        build up a society based on moderation. In any case, a sustained and creative effort would be required to deal with this insidious phenomenon.
       - Alleviation of Poverty and Creation of Jobs- Currently about 4014 of people in Bangladesh live under the poverty line and lifting this huge group out of poverty will pose the

     largest development challenges in the coming years. The present government has also repeatedly expressed their commitment to tight this menace through variety of programmes.
     Another related issue involves the creation of jobs for the people. In Bangladesh, about 2.5 million job seekers are joining the work force every year and roughly 1 million jobs are
     created both domestically and externally. A big gap always exists between the demand and supply of jobs. Needless to say, accelerated creation of jobs could also serve to sanitize
                                                    the society from all extremist ideas, which often threaten the basic fabric of our society.

        - Infrastructure- This is a daunting area for Bangladesh to address. Several components could be put in this mix. First, the issue of physical infrastructure, which includes the
      building of network of physical connectivity, such as road, railways, waterways, airports, seaports, and telecommunications, and IT, among others, deserves attention. In order to
     accelerate economic growth Bangladesh has not only to significantly upgrade such infrastructure within the country but she must also align them suitably to connect with the larger
      regional network. Second, Bangladesh will have to build up an energy infrastructure with a view to meeting the growing demand for energy as her economy grows. Govenunent

      anticipates that Bangladesh economy will grow by 8% by 2013 and by 10% by 2017. We must also not ignore the fact that the demand for energy in both China and India is also
       growing at an annual rate of 10%, and Bangladesh has to be creative in exploring its domestic sources as well as taping into the regional matrix, which could perhaps meet the
       regional demand for energy for many years to come. Third, building up a good managerial infrastructure through upgrading the quality of her human resources infrastructure is
         also a top priority for Bangladesh. According to many everts Bangladesh cannot aspire to be on a higher growth trajectory without the quality human resources, both at the

       government and private sector level to back it up. In order to achieve this objective, there is an urgent need to align the education system, particularly the higher education, with
       global standard, including enabling students to learn several foreign languages and building an IT enabled generation as well as reorienting bureaucracy to serve private sector
   . driven economic growth with adequate Knowledge and expertise. Ambassador Farooq Sobhan has rightly called them Oprivate sector minded bureaucracy. 0 Perhaps what we

     also need is a globally minded bureaucracy, which would be able to effectively facilitate mobilization of private capital, technology, Irnowledge andlrnowhow from global sources.
      Needless to say that Bangladesh cannot overcome the existing challenge on infrastructure without huge infusion of foreign capital, teclmology and expertise, among other things.

         - Managing shared Resources and Environment- Like many other countries. Bangladesh shares vital resources with other neighbouring countries. Take the case of our river
     systems. Out of 200 plus rivers in Bangladesh, 54 rivers flow from India and at least one of them from China. Nepal is also linked in this riverine network. While adequate quantity
       of water is critical for sustenance and economic growth in Bangladesh, keeping a watch on the quality of water that flows into Bangladesh is also important. Flora and fauna of
     Bangladesh, and indeed the larger ecosystem in Bangladesh is dependent of maintairiing the quantity and quality of water system in Bangladesh. As the demand for water increases

     with economic progress. Bangladesh has to ensure its due share over this critical source of live and livelihood. Creative options have also to be explored to share this vital resource
        keeping in view the growing needs of all riparian nations, including Bangladesh. Again, all South Asian stations are more of less affected by the issue of climate change. Their
     leaders have agreed during the last Thimphu Summit to forge a common position for dealing with this common challenge. Yet, the contribution of each country to carbon emission
       and Use impact which they suffer are different, and as such each station will have to pursues nuanced strategy to protect her interests within the larger context of ongoing global

       negotiations on this issue. Likewise, Bangladesh shares energy resources with both Myanmar and India in the Bay of Bengal. Already Bangladesh in engaged in arbitration with
       them through the multilateral process. It is most likely that more serious negotiations will ensue soon, and a great deal of creativity will have to brought to bear in resolving the
                                      maritime boundary issue to the satisfaction of all parties, and to share the energy resources available in that region.
             Raising Competitiveness- At the same time, Bangladesh badly needs to raise its economic competitiveness. Bangladesh has consistently performed poorly on Global

     Competitiveness Index, and unfortunately changes in government in recent years have not had any significant impact on improving our economic competitiveness. Perhaps, a fresh
        and professional look has to be taken by the policy makers on an urgent basis to complement the heroic efforts of private sector in raising our competitiveness. Otherwise, our
         policy incentives will produce only modest results. On the other hand, an economically competitive Bangladesh will derive multiple benefits. It will open up snore space for
            Bangladesh in global trade; it will also attract foreign investment, which could play a vital role in transferring resources, technology, expertise and management skills.
                                                                                        Agenda for Action

      A number of policy options could be explored to enetgize our foreign policy with a view to supporting our transition to a middle income country and creating space for advancing
       our vital interests in the region and beyond. Our diplomacy produced good results when the global system was perhaps predictable; we need a stew approach now to reach out to
                             new constituency of global actors in the fast changing global context. Some of the elements for the new framework are noted below:
         a. Redesign our Foreign Policy- Our foreign policy outlook and framework is at best traditional in nature, so are our diplomatic instruments. Dramatic changes, which have

      occurred in concepts and practices in diplomacy during the last 20 years, are   not appropriately absorbed and reflected in our foreign policy. This lag costs Bangladesh in term of
       effectiveness of her foreign policy. One example will perhaps suffice. The Embassy of Bangladesh carried out a survey among 1000 Nepalese citizens in four different cities in
          2006 to understand their awareness about Bangladesh and her foreign policy achievements. Among other questions, we asked them if they would recall any foreign policy
          initiative Bangladesh had taken in recent years on a regional scale. A large number of respondents only recalled the role of Bangladesh in the creation of SAARC in 1985.

        Surprisingly it was 20 years ago by then! Such a response alerted us to the Met that we had fallen far behind in terms of drawing attention of common people with our foreign
       policy, even within the region and more so in a friendly neighbouring nation like Nepal. Now, with a view to redesigning our foreign policy five areas could be looked at. They
                                                                                             include:
       i.Adopting a look arotind policy, instead of looking in one direction. This would include exploring all options in building relationship with all neighbours on the basis of mutual
                                                                                             benefit;

       ii.Articulating a Bilateral plus policy, which is essentially a process of working with multiple partners to achieve major policy objectives, even within the region; Such a policy
                                                                 would essentially complement bilateral relations, not replace it.
              Supporting robust regionalism and sub- regionalism, which could create spice for capitalizing on larger opportunities; This could allow Bangladesh to capitalize on its

                                                                                      geographical location;
                                     iv. Pursuing a creative and flexible multilateralism., which demands nimble diplomacy cm issues of common concerns;
        v. Engaging in continuous innovations in our diplomacy, including building coalitions with civil society actors to advance shared objectives. After all, as Princeton University

       scholar Anne- Marie Slaughter lias rightly observed, the emerging networked world of the twenty first century exists above the state, below the state, and through the state. In
                                                                                                                                                               s0 Incidentally, the most
          this world, the state with most connections will bathe central player, able to set the global agenda and unlock innovation and sustainable growth.
     networked nations are not the powerful and big states. Singapore. Norway and Costa Rica are the ones, which are most nimble and active in this regard Is not the message clear for
                                                                                           Bangladesh?
          b. Expanding Outreach and Reputation Management through Public Diplomacy- As policy process attracts new actors, the need for extending the outreach with a view to

       incorporating the new actors into policy process and to seek their help to put into effect such policies has grown enormously. This could be done both at home and abroad. Many
       countries, such as Canada and Norway pursue such a strategy with great effectiveness. This is particularly relevant also for nations, which suffer from reputation deficit, such as
     Bangladesh. Reputation or image deficit affects Bangladesh at least on three counts: it deprives Bangladesh of the opportunity of getting a suitable context to conduct its diplomacy
       abroad in an effective manner. British scholar Mark Leonard observed, "Image and reputation of a country are public goods which can create either art enabling or a disenabling

      nwironment for individual transactions. Work on particular issue will feed off the general image of the country and reflect back on to it-in both positive and negative directions.,
            Second, in the absence of right kind of collective image we tend to either sink into invisibility or portrayed negatively; consequently we do not figure out in the global

     conversations. Third, a distorted image, which often is the function of others defining us instead of we defining ourselves, affects our business potential as well. For example, in the
      Middle Eastern countries Bangladesh is a major supplier of workets for the last 25 years; we contributed to their economic growth as well. Yet Bangladesh is regularly associated
         with supplying only unskilled and low end workers. When the issue of importing semi skilled and skilled workers comes, they tend to prefer other countries in the region, for

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776994 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

   example Sri Lanka and India. While emerging nations, such as China and India, which are carefully creating their brand image as a nation, it looks like we are frozen in our old and
       outdated perception about our inflated self image. Bangladesh needs to wake up from this slumber sooner than later. Experts have suggested a useful tool, namely Public
    Diplomacy, for articulating a realistic and credible strategy to present the stories of a nation to outside audience. Indeed, many nations, including some developing countries have
      already integrated public diplomacy in their foreign policy toolkit Given the growing capacity and potential influence of Bangladeshi Diaspora in many countries around the
    world, perhaps it is time to articulate a Public Diplomacy programme, which will facilitate their participation in the policy process, among other things. A word of caution would
     perhaps be in older at this point. Contrary to traditional perception, Public Diplomacy is not about manipulating information to present official version of developments to the
      foreign audience, nor is it an episodal shot to serve short term political gains either. It is rather a process of engagement with the target audience with a view to building up a
    audience. For Bangladesh leveraging Bangladeshi culture and social creativity could form a credible plank of public diplomacy. It is important to note that Public Diplomacy is nots of local
    an end in itself; it is a support to advance the overall interests of a nation through reaching out to all segments of host societies. These days, some experts also talk about domestic
                                                        part of Public Diplomacy.
     c.The Whole Government Approach- Our current foreign policy approach is highly bureaucratic, vertical and as such fragmented. Foreign Ministry is considered like any other
      Ministry, while functionally its scope is global in the sense that the Ministry and the Diplomatic Missions protect and promote our vital national interests, spanning over wide
      range of issues, around the globe. As the process of domestic interconnected has increased resulting in growing interactions among nations on a variety of issues of common
    concerns, it has become necessary to articulate a whole government approach to deal with issues that have national relevance. Considering the value of horizontal cooperation in
     dealing with complex problems President Obama had recently advocated such an approach in his National Security Strategy document of 2010. One could argue that the inter-
                                   Ministerial consultations, which exist now, could somehow compensate for such a need.
      Yet, the value of high level contact cannot be underestimated. One model for consideration for such high level contact could include a Ministerial Coordination Committee
    Minister for Finance, Minister for Commerce, Minister for Expatriate Welfare, Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism and Executive Chairman, BOI, among others. A suitableffairs, .
    Representative from the Ministry of Defense could also be included on issues relating to peacekeeping and disaster management issues. Needless to say, all these initiatives would
     bear fruit only when they receive strong commitment from the highest political level The coordination role should however always remain with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
                                                   like the role of a conductor in a symphony.
     d. Strengthening MOFA and Missions- Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Diplomatic Missions abroad have been given the responsibility to conduct Bangladesh
    Foreign Policy in the most effective manner, several impediments have diminished their ability to perform at the optimum level. One is the shortage of officers in the Ministry of
      Foreign Affairs and the existing organogram is outdated by thirty years. It is important to upgrade the same so that the strength of the Ministry could be doubled, as had been
      suggested by Ambassador Farooq Sobhan This suggestion is very much in line with what our neighbours are doing in the light of new global reality. India is expanding her
     Foreign Service cadre, so is being done by China. Nepal is also expanding its Foreign Service cadre with a new law, which would give them the coordinating role on all issues •
   global issues have to be followed, understood, examined, discussed and negotiated with multiple actors on the global scale, which can only be done by the well groomed diplomats.ging
    For Bangladesh, which has to leverage on soft power, it is the diplomats who also constitute the first line of defense! On the other hand, budgetary limitation has also stymied the
     initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Likewise, Diplomatic Missions have to be re-tooled with new mission to dnunatically expand their outreach to all stakeholders and
    actors, who can have an impact on Bangladesh. Accordingly, it is necessary to support them with research and financial resources. Enhancement in resources must be matched with
      improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of Bangladesh diplomats. Consideration could be given to holding a kind of Quadrennial Review on Diplomacy to assess the
    changing global scenario and to evaluate the effectiveness of our diplomacy vis a via such transformations. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has launched such a Review for US
    State Department in 2009. A rigorous performance evaluation mechanism should be developed to assess the performance of the Heads of Mission and other diplomats posted in the
     Missions. Experiences of some of our neighbouring countries in this regard could be helpful. In order to ensure smooth and professional tluictioning of the diplomatic Missions,
    the authority of the Heads of Missions should be further strengthened and the entire team should be responsible to him for performance of their duties. For some time, the issue of
     tForeign Policy Advisory Body with retired and experienced diplomats, who could advise the Ministry on various issues suitably. Many counties maintain such a system of form a
                                                             consultations.
                                                              Conclusion
    Diplomacy has moved from traditional format of Club Model to Crisis Management model, from vertical bureaucratic model to horizontal network model. Now foreign policy has
     to address two fundamental phenomena, which have characterized the contemporary global scenario: managing change and dealing with regional and global crises arising out of
     Multiple interactions of myriad actors. We therefore need a new orientation in our foreign policy, need more flexible and creative outlook, need new institutional mechanism and
    need new set of skills to build coalitions with all actors with a view to managing the evolving reality on the ground. Above all, what we need is the attention and mderstanding of
    Sic political leadership to lead this process of change. Reorganizing the diplomatic set up along with aligning other domestic setup to support the creative diplomatic endeavour is
    international coinmunusnot forget the hard reality that our effort to build a democratic, dynamic, decent Bangladesh in the coining years would be as robust and as vibrantmbers of
                                                           as our diplomacy is!

       Draft5/8/12                                                           <span class="unclassified">RELEASE IN FULL</span>

                     A Vision for a World Food Stewardship Council:
                         Addressing the World's Major Food Crises

                                       Kelly D. Brownell, Ph.D.
                                            Yale University

              Three major food crises threaten the world's ability to cope. Hunger and
       undernutrition, obesity/overnutrition, and unsustainable food production practices raise
       pressing questions about human rights, catastrophic health care costs, national security,
       global political stability, and the health of the planet.

              The world's population will reach 9.1 billion by 2050, an increase of 34%, most
       of which will occur in developing countries where undernutrition, overweight, and
       environmental issues form a triple burden[1]. Global demand for food is expected to
       increase by 70% at a time when crops are used increasingly for bioenergy and industrial
       purposes and stresses on arable land are extreme[1]. Proceeding with the status quo will

       lead to highly undesirable outcomes, including regional and global instability

              There is the need for an immediate, far-reaching, non-partisan effort to address
       both short-term and long-term issues with food on a global basis. This paper presents a
       vision for the creation of a World Food Stewardship Council. The Council, if adequately
       funded and both backed and managed by highly trusted individuals and organizations,

       could assemble relevant stakeholders, coordinate efforts across business, private, and
       government sectors, undertake strategic research, and provide guidance to a world in
       need of solutions.

                                   Food Crises in a World Context

               The world has long recognized hunger and food insecurity as major global issues
       [2-4]. More than 1 billion people worldwide are undernourished, with numbers much
       larger if deficiencies in nutrients such as iron and Vitamin A are considered. Further,
       rates of deficiencies have risen in recent years due to instability in world food prices and
       economic conditions generally[2]. The combination of macronutrient, micronutrient, and

       calorie insufficiency leads to negative effects on every organ system in the body, poverty,
       educational disadvantage, and far-reaching political consequences. Children, adolescents,
       and pregnant women being especially vulnerable.

              Newer on the scene is obesity. Considerable human suffering, extreme health care
       costs, and high prevalence (1.5 billion people are overweight) make overnutrition a

       pressing global issue. The World Health Organization estimates that 65% of the world's

                                                                                                1

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05795773 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

       population live in countries where overweight kills more people than does underweight

       [5].

             Modern food production and consumption patterns are of concern not only to
       human health but to the ability of the planet to survive. The loss of arable land, shrinking
       biodiversity, depletion of water supplies, the heavy use of petroleum resources for
       industrial farming, and climate change are but a few relevant issues. By 2025 for
       instance, 2/3 of the world's population will be affected by serious stress on water

       supplies; 70% of water is used for agriculture[6]. Animal agriculture, which draws
       heavily on finite resources such as water and oil, and leads to emissions of carbon
       dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, now surpasses transport as a contributor to global
       warming[7].

              These three areas can be seen as corners of a triangle, where each of the areas
       intersects with the others, and where there is potential for seeking common ground but

       also for conflict and working at cross-purposes (Figure 1).

                                            Figure 1

                                         Unsustainable

                                           Agriculture

                                                                           Obesity and
           Hunger and
         Undernutrition                                                   Overnutrition

              The health of individuals is at stake, but also the health of the environment,
       whether economies can thrive, and the political fates of countries. As example, one could
       readily imagine countries coming to serious conflict over the water in a shared lake or
       river, countries making heavy use of natural resources in food production being

                                                                                           2

       sanctioned by world bodies, and even more vast numbers of people dying from food-
       related problems. These daunting outcomes may seem distant, but could arise in a few
       decades.

                                     Who Tends to These Issues?

              Each of the three world food concerns is addressed by government agencies,
       NG0s, scientific experts, bodies of research and reports, and global organizations such as
       the Food and Agriculture Organization, World Health Organization, and World Bank.
       Coordination or integration of efforts across parties is inadequate given the magnitude of

       the problems, resources are inadequate and splintered, few opportunities exist to examine
       how policies and practices affect all three problems, and in some cases the players square
       off on controversial issues.

              There are numerous examples of how progress in one area can be considered a
       problem in others. The use of genetically modified foods and petroleum based fertilizers

       that have led to food production increases in poor countries as part of the Green
       Revolution raises questions about impacts on biodiversity and the environment. Experts
       in the obesity field have proposed that SNAP benefits (food stamps) in the US not be
       used to buy sugar-sweetened beverages, a policy opposed by many in the anti-hunger
       community[8]. Because parts of the food system are affected by changes in others, there
       is need for cooperation, coordination, and ingenuity that creates wins across all areas.

               In 1974, the United Nations General Assembly voted to create a World Food
       Council, a separate UN organization designed primarily to deal with hunger and
       malnutrition. Lack of funding, questions about authority, and difficulties with other UN
       organizations such as the FAO led to the demise of the World Food Council in 1993. The
       duties were absorbed into the FAO.

               In 1974, the UN created the Administrative Committee on Coordination
       Subcommittee on Nutrition whose task it was to address hunger and malnutrition by
       coordinating activities across UN agencies. This evolved to the present day UN Standing
       Committee on Nutrition (UNSCN) whose primary task still involves malnutrition. It is a
       committee that reports to a committee, issues reports, and does outreach to nutrition

       practitioners globally.

               Existing organizations play an important role, but food crises remain and more
       must be done. Creating a new organization outside existing structures, but connected to
       them, may offer the best hope for progress.

                                 A World Food Stewardship Council

       The Vision
               A call is hereby issued for the creation of a World Food Stewardship Council
       whose mandate is to: a) Convene world leaders, experts and other stakeholders with the

                                                                                                 3

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05795773 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

       aim of solving world food problems; b) Develop solutions that simultaneously address
       these problems; c) Act as an integrative body to keep relevant parties informed of
       developments; d) Commission and support strategic research projects that fill key gaps in
       knowledge; e) Develop model policies; 1) Work with world leaders to have policies
       implemented and evaluated.

               The creation of a World Food Stewardship Council could provide an opportunity
       for much needed dialogue between areas, but only if key stakeholders (the very top
       leaders in different sectors) agree to convene. Dialogue is just the one step toward the
       goal of healthy, vital people living on a healthy planet. The Council would work with
       global leaders to identify the most pressing issues, collect the necessary background

       information, assemble experts, carry out or support any needed research, issue reports,
       and follow through with all stakeholders in the service of insuring maximal reach and
       impact.

       Structure, Governance, and Issues
               Governance of the Council would have representation from six key communities

       (Figure 2): 1) Public health &amp; science; 2) Funding organizations (e.g., foundations) and
       groups with global reach; 3) Relevant global agencies such as FAO, WHO, World Bank,
       WTO, etc.; 4) Industry; 5) Finance and Economics; and 6) NGOs that represent the three
       areas. The overriding spirit would be to nurture a non-partisan effort where real efforts
       would be made to   solve real problems.

               A Governing Board comprised of the six groups depicted in Figure 2 would help
        establish priorities, coordinate fundraising, and work closely with Council staff to insure
        projects are carried out capably and expeditiously. This board, because of its visibility
       and prestige, would also be instrumental in coordinating with world leaders to get input
       and to insure impact.

               The principles underlying governance are involvement of relevant stakeholders,
        equity across stakeholders, low likelihood that any one stakeholder could hijack the
        process, a non-partisan process, avoidance of conflicts of interest, and solutions created
        by input from creative and visionary individuals.

               Housing such an organization within the United Nations would seem reasonable
        at first glance, as the UN has a global governance structure in place and has existing
        organizations in place that deal with food and health issues (FAO, WHO, UNSCN). UN
        agencies, however, can get buffeted by political winds, have funding limitations, and can
        be hampered by internal disputes over authority.

               There are dozens of examples of issues that might be tackled. The Council could
        address how world trade policy affects food and nutrition issues, how agriculture
        subsidies affect the world food supply and prices, how climate change will shift where
        specific crops are grown, how to protect the environment while feeding the world, how
        forest protection is affected by heavy cultivation of crops such as oil palm, barriers to
        food distribution, food marketing, to name just a few issues.

                                                                                                  4

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05795773 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

              Not all problems will be solved. There will be areas where stakeholders cannot
       agree. There will be cases where solutions will be proposed but not implemented. Yet, it
       is essential to try.

                                             Figure 2

       Funding and Leadership
               Funding and help with development of a leadership team would best come from
       institutions and foundations known for global scope, vision, and bipartisanship. Examples

       would be the Gates Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Bloomberg Foundation,
       Wellcome Trust. Other stakeholders would not be in a position to fund such efforts (e.g.,
       scientists) or might be seen as having vested interests (e.g., industry).

       Threats

               Several threats could make a World Food Stewardship Council impossible to
       launch or might create a weak organization without reach or impact. Perceived or actual
       partisanship would undermine credibility and discourage key players from taking part.
       Lack of funding would minimize reach. Unless high profile leaders from different sectors

                                                                                               5

       took part, the stature, visibility, and significance of the Council would be reduced. Above
       all, the spirit of urgency, cooperation, and working toward meaningful solutions must be
       present or the effort would be strangled by competing interests.

                                              Su mma  ry

              There is a pressing need to address global food issues in ways that lead to more
       than reports and conferences — there must be solutions. The creation of a World Food
       Stewardship Council is proposed as a step in this direction. With the right governance,
       staffing, funding, visibility, and stature, the Council could play an important role in

       addressing major world food issues.

Re: Qaddafi's Scuds and strategy for holding on
</span>

On the morning of February 25, a former official of the government of Muammar

Qaddafi stated in confidence that he and other former members of the Qaddafi regime are

concerned by the knowledge that the soldiers and officers assigned to the Libyan Army's

Scud Missile Battalions remain loyal to Qaddafi. While the issue remains open as to

whether or not the Libyan government maintains small quantities of mustard gas and

other Weapons of Mass Destructio i, Qaddafi's forces can use these Scuds to carry

conventional high explosives, and launch random, but destructive attacks

against Benghazi, Tobruk or other towns under the control of anti-government forces.

          <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791947 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

Source Comment: These sources repeated their earlier warning that Qaddafi would not

tesitate to use all of the resources at his disposal to attack civilian, political, and economic

argets if he feels he is on the verge of being defeated by anti-government troops.)

during the afternoon of February 25, Qaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam stated in private that his

tither is convinced he can hold power, if he can maintain control of portions of Tripoli for the

text ten (10) days. Saif al-Islam states that it is important to remember that his father is still the
lead of State in Libya, and that the UN and the major nations of the world are reluctant to

lepose a sitting Head of State. (Source Comment: The United States invasions of Iraq and

 .fghanistan sere as the examples that prove the rule in this case.) The Libyan diplomats

erving abroad who remain loyal to Qaddafi have been instructed to press this point with other
;overnments. These diplomats are particularly active in sub Saharan African, and at this point

;aif al-Islam is pleased with what he considers the rather mild reaction of these states to the

violence used by forces loyal to Qaddafi in suppressing anti-government activities in

,ibya. Saif al-Islam believes that while the leaders of countries like Chad, Benin, and Burkina
 a.so must call for an end to violence, they will continue to stop short of statements supporting

he demonstrators. By the same token the Organization of African Unity (OAU), after delaying

is response to the violence for several days, has limited its statements to an expression of

oncern.
The current President of the OAU is Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the President of

F,quatorial Guinea, who, according to well placed sources, considers himself a friend and

.upporter of Qaddafi. Mbasogo received support from Libya when he seized power in a violent

nilitary coup d'etat in 1979, and he has remained loyal to Qaddafi over the years. Mbasogo
eceives technical and business advice from Libyan experts, particularly in managing Equatorial

guinea's substantial oil resources.

;ince coming to power in 1969 Qaddafi has worked to establish strong relationships with the

leads of State in many sub-Saharan African nations. This support has included technical and
financial aid, military support, and private payments to the various Heads of State. According

o Saif al-Islam, Qaddfi believes these African states will now continue support him as he deals

vith the rebellion in Libya. Well placed sources report that Mbasogo has received millions of

Collars in private payments fromthe Qaddafi regime.

since 1969, Qaddafi has been one of the only Islamic leaders in North Africa to seek out cordial
elations with the nations of sub-Saharan Africa. According to a former official of the Kenyan

;overnment, these African states feel that the Islamic nations of North Africa look down on

heir southern neighbors and focus most their attention on relations with the Arab states of the

✓fiddle East. Libya and Israel are the two countries of North Africa and the Middle East who
Lave invested substantial time, money and personnel resources in supporting these African

tates. For its part, Kenya has a history of conflict with Libya rooted in the Cold War, however,

his individual notes that even these relations improved after the 2003-2004 Libyan agreement

vith the Western powers regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction.
Source Comment: The leaders of the OAU states also fear that the wave of anti-corruption

arrest that is sweeping North Africa will spread south. This is particularly true in the case of

lictators like Mbasogo and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe. However, even elected leaders like

south Africa's Jakob Zuma must be concerned because of the economic downturn in their
:ountries and the rampant corruption that exists across Africa. It is highly unlikely that these

k.frican states will support any attempt by the UN, or NATO to organize some form of military

esponse to the Libyan situation, including the establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya.)

 Re: US mentor to Egyptian revolutionaries
</span>

 The New York Times today discloses that youthful non-violent Egyptian revolutionaries have
 been inspired by the work of an American political thinker on non-violent resistance, Gene
 Sharp, who spent decades at Harvard. (See NYT article and bio of Sharp below.)

 You might consider inviting him to see you and then sending him on a State Department USIS
 tour.

 NYT:

 Breaking free from older veterans of the Arab political opposition, they relied on tactics of
 nonviolent resistance channeled from an American scholar through a Serbian youth brigade —
 but also on marketing tactics borrowed from Silicon Valley.

 For their part, Mr. Maher and his colleagues began reading about nonviolent struggles. They
 were especially drawn to a Serbian youth movement called Otporwhich had helped topple the
 dictatorSlobodan Milosevic by drawing on the ideas of an American political thinkGene
 Sharp. The hallmark of Mr. Sharp's work is well-tailored to Mr. Mubark's Egypt: He argues that
 nonviolence is a singularly effective way to undermine police stthat might cite violent
 resistance to jusb) repression in the name of stability.

 Dual Uprisings Show Potent New Threats to

 Arab States

  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and DAVID E. SANGER

 CAIRO — As protesters in Tahrir Square faced off against pro-government forces, they drew a
  lesson from their counterparts in Tunisia: "Advice to the youth of Egypt: Put vinegar or onion
  under your scarf for tear gas."

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05779104 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

   In Washington that day, President Obama turned up, unexpectedly, at a 3:30 p.m. Situation
   Room meeting of his "principals," the key members of the national security team, where he
   displaced Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, from his seat at the head of the table.

   The White House had been debating the likelihood of a domino effect since youth-driven revolts
   had toppled President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia, even though the American intelligence
   community and Israel's intelligence services had estimated that the risk to President Mubarak
   was low — less than 20 percent, some officials said.

   According to senior officials who participated in Mr. Obama's policy debates, the president took
   a different view. He made the point early on, a senior official said, that "this was a trend" that
   could spread to other authoritarian governments in the region, including in Iran. By the end of
   the 18-day uprising, by a White House count, there were 38 meetings with the president about

   Egypt. Mr. Obama said that this was a chance to create an alternative to "the Al Qaeda narrative"
   of Western interference.

   American officials had seen no evidence of overtly anti-American or anti-Western sentiment
   "When we saw people bringing their children to Tahrir Square, wanting to see history being

   made, we knew this was something different," one official said.

   On Jan. 28, the debate quickly turned to how to pressure Mr. Mubarak in private and in public —
   and whether Mr. Obama should appear on television urging change. Mr. Obama decided to call
   Mr. Mubarak, and several aides listened in on the line. Mr. Obama did not suggest that the 82-

   year-old leader step aside or transfer power. At this point, "the argument was that he really
   needed to do the reforms, and do them fast," a senior official said. Mr. Mubarak resisted, saying
   the protests were about outside interference.

   According to the official, Mr. Obama told him, "You have a large portion of your people who are
   not satisfied, and they won't be until you make concrete political, social and economic reforms."

   The next day, the decision was made to send former Ambassador Frank G. Wisner to Cairo as an
   envoy. Mr. Obama began placing calls to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Prime
   Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and other regional leaders.

   The most difficult calls, officials said, were with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Mr.
  Netanyahu, who feared regional instability and urged the United States to stick with Mr.
   Mubarak. According to American officials, senior members of the government in Saudi Arabia
  argued that the United States should back Mr. Mubarak even if he used force against the
   demonstrators. By Feb. 1, when Mr. Mubarak broadcast a speech pledging that he would not run
  again and that elections would be held in September, Mr. Obama concluded that the Egyptian

   president still had not gotten the message.

  Within an hour, Mr. Obama called Mr. Mubarak again in the toughest, and last, of their
  conversations. "He said if this transition process drags out for months, the protests will, too," one
  of Mr. Obama's aides said.

  Mr. Mubarak told Mr. Obama that the protests would be over in a few days.

  Mr. Obama ended the call, the official said, with these words: "I respect my elders. And you
  have been in politics for a very long time, Mr. President. But there are moments in history when
  just because things were the same way in the past doesn't mean they will be that way in the

  future."

 Liberal Dems in uproar over Libya

 By:  John Bresnahan and Jonathan Allen
 March 19, 2011 04:27 PM EDT

 A hard-core group of liberal House Democrats is questioning the constitutionality of U.S.
 missile strikes against Libya, with one lawmaker raising the prospect of impeachment

 during a Democratic Caucus conference call on Saturday.

 Reps. Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.), Donna Edwards (Md.), Mike Capuano (Mass.), Dennis
 Kucinich (Ohio), Maxine Waters (Calif.), Rob Andrews (N.J.), Sheila Jackson Lee (Texas),

 Barbara Lee (Calif.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D.C.) "all strongly raised objections
 to the constitutionality of the president's actions" during that call, said two Democratic
 lawmakers who took part.

 Kucinich, who wanted to bring impeachment articles against both former President
 George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney over Iraq — only to be blocked by his
 own leadership — asked why the U.S. missile strikes aren't impeachable offenses.

 Kucinich also questioned why Democratic leaders didn't object when President Barack
 Obama told them of his plan for American participation in enforcing the Libyan no-fly zone
 during a White House Situation Room meeting on Friday, sources told POLITICO.

 And liberals fumed that Congress hadn't been formally consulted before the attack and
 expressed concern that it would lead to a third U.S. war in the Muslim world.

 While other Democratic lawmakers have publicly backed Obama — including House
 Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and top members of the Armed Services, Foreign
 Affairs and Intelligence committees — the objections from a vocal group of anti-war

 Democrats on Capitol Hill could become a political problem for Obama, especially if
 "Operation Odyssey Dawn" fails to topple Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi, leads to

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780097 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

significant American casualties, or provokes a wider conflict in the troubled region of North
Africa.

(Pelosi did not participate in Saturdays call; she is in Afghanistan to meet with U.S.
military and diplomatic officials.)

U.S. warships fired more than 100 Tomahawk cruise missies on Saturday in a bid to
knock out Libya's air-defense systems, targeting command-and-control and radar units
near Tripoli, the Libyan capital, and the city of Misurata, according to Pentagon officials

and media reports. French aircraft attacked armored units loyal to Qadhafi around the city
of Benghazi after they ignored international calls for a cease-fire.

Saturday's conference call was organized by Rep. John Larson (Conn.), chairman of the
Democratic Caucus and the fourth-highest ranking party leader. Larson has called for
Obama to seek congressional approval before committing the United States to any anti-
Qadhafi military operation.

"They consulted the Arab League. They consulted the United Nations. They did not
consult the United States Congress," one Democrat lawmaker said of the White House.
"They're creating wreckage, and they can't obviate that by saying there are no boots on

the ground. ... There aren't boots on the ground; there are Tomahawks in the air."

"Almost everybody who spoke was opposed to any unilateral actions or decisions being

made by the president, and most of us expressed our constitutional concerns. There
should be a resolution and there should be a debate so members of Congress can decide
whether or not we enter in whatever this action is being called," added another House
Democrat opposed to the Libyan operation.

"Whose side are we on? This appears to be more of a civil war than some kind of a
revolution. Who are protecting? Are we with the people that are supposedly opposed to
[Qadhafij? You think they have a lot of people with him? If he is deposed, who will we be

dealing with? There are a lot of questions here from members."

The unrest among Hill Democrat resembles, in part, the debates inside the White House,
Pentagon and State Department over the last few weeks as the Libyan crisis has

unfolded.

The White House has worked to put out a narrative over the last 48 hours portraying
Obama as initially opposed to any involvement in a Libyan campaign, with a major change

in the president's viewpoint developing over the course of the last week as Qadhafi
loyalists appeared to be gaining the upper hand and a humanitarian crisis appeared
inevitable.

While Defense Secretary Robert Gates led administration opponents of any U.S. role in
the anti-Qadhafi operation, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton backed calls from the French
and British governments for a NATO-led effort to assist the Libyan rebels. The Clinton

clique eventually prevailed in the debate, and Clinton then worked with U.S. allies to craft
a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the mission.

The Security Council then approved a resolution on Friday authorizing a "no-fly zone" for

portions of Libya controlled by anti-Qadhafi rebels, as well as "all necessary measures to

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780097 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

protect civilians under threat of attack in the country," according to a U.N. statement.

With U.S. attacks already being launched, it was unclear what, if anything, Democratic
opponents of the Libyan campaign could actually do to stop it. They could try to offer an
amendment for under the 1973 War Powers Act, which would require a withdrawal of U.S.
forces from any conflict within 60 days if the president lacks congressional approval,

although it is unlikely that pass.

They could also seek to cut off funding for any extended military effort, although it is
unclear how long or what the White House anticipates the cost of the operation could be.

Kucinich's call to explore the impeachment question "got no support from anyone else on
the call," said another Democrat.

Yet there is growing unhappiness within Democratic ranks on Obama's handling of the
Afghanistan conflict, and with Obama gearing up for his 2012 reelection campaign, he will
need the backing of liberal and progressive factions within his party — already
disenchanted over some of the president's fiscal and tax policies — in order to defeat any

Republican challenger.

Recent opinion polls show the American public is also tiring of the Afghan war. On
Thursday, 85 House Democrats — and eight Republicans — backed a Kucinich resolution

calling for removal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan by Dec. 31.

A total of 321 House members, including Pelosi and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.),
opposed the Kucinich measure.

On the Senate side, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) offered a similar resolution, but so far, it
has only garnered three cosponsors.

                                                                                        0

Explanation of Vote by Ambassador Brooke Anderson, U.S. Alternate Representative for
Special Political Affairs, on MINURSO, in the Security Council Chamber
Brooke Anderson

U.S. Alternate Representative for Special Political Affairs
U.S. Mission to the United Nations
New York, NY
April 30, 2010

                                       AS DELIVERED

The United States fully supports the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy Chris Ross in
their efforts to find a peaceful, sustainable, mutually-agreed solution to the Western Sahara
conflict and welcomes the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Western Sahara
and head of MINURSO Hany Abdel-aziz.

We welcome the fact that, during Ambassador Ross' recent trip to the region, all of his
interlocutors confirmed their commitment to cooperate with the United Nations to reach a
solution to the Western Sahara conflict as soon as possible.

We encourage all involved to come to the table without preconditions. This conflict has
languished for too long, and has hindered regional cooperation on urgent and emergent issues

facing North Africa.

We believe it is essential that the parties demonstrate the political will to identify a mutually-
acceptable solution, and we hope that neighboring states will assist the parties in doing so.

We call on the parties to work collaboratively with the UNHCR to facilitate the implementation

of their agreement regarding family visits, including the establishment of family visits by land.
We hope that family visits by air will be resumed as soon as possible, and that the parties will
engage constructively with each other and the Personal Envoy of the Secretary General to
pursue other forms of confidence building measures.

We are deeply concerned about the allegations of human rights abuses by the parties. We urge

the parties to work with the international community to ensure full respect for human rights in
both Western Sahara and in the Tindouf camps.

In this context, we underscore the importance of making progress on the human rights situation.

Given the current situation on the ground and Ambassador Ross' continuing efforts, we agree
the presence of MINURSO remains indispensable and that is why we have just supported

renewing MINURSO's mandate for another 12 months.

Thank you Mr. President.

EXCLUSIVE: Bill Clinton Says He Wouldn't Rule Out Arming
Libya's Rebels

'I'm Just Speaking For Myself,' Former President Says

By SUZAN CLARICE

April 3, 2011 —

Former U.S. President Bill Clintonsaid he thinks the United States should consider arming the rebelsLibya's
civil war.

"It would depend ... and I might need to know a little more, but I would be inclined to do it," Clinton told
correspondent Bianna Golodryga today in San Diego during an exclusive interview with ABC News.

Clinton was in San Diego for his annualClinton Global InitiativUniversity Meeting.

The uprising in Libya stared in February during a wave of social and political unrest in the Middle East.
Fighting has escalated all across the country, but the rebels have found themselves outgunned by Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Gadhafi's   forces, which are better equipped.

Last month the United Nations authorized a no-fly zone over the North African nation to prevent further attacks
on civilians from Gadhafi's troops in the air.

Clinton on Arming Rebels: 'I Sure Wouldn't Shut the Door to It'

The United States backed the no-fly zone and has also authorized additional support for the anti-Gadhafi
fighters, but key U.S. lawmakers and top officials in the government President Barack Obama  have said they
are not comfortable with arming the rebels -- apparently because not enough is known about them.

But Clinton said he wouldn't completely rule out the idea of supplying arms to Libya's rebels.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05779695 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

"Let me just say this. I sure wouldn't shut the door to it. I think ... we may need to know a little more," he said.

Clinton, husband of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, stressed that he was speaking without "any official
sanction" whatsoever.

"I'm just speaking from myself. But I certainly wouldn't take that off the table, too," he said.

Watch More of Interview With Bill Clinton Monday on 'Good Morning America'

Gadhafi is the focus of an investigation by the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

Watch "Good Morning America" tomorrow for the full interview and hear Clinton speak about his
summit, the looming government shutdown and the controversy over President Obama's birth certificate.

    MEMORANDUM FOR SECRETARY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON

 <span class="inlinemeta">From:	        Miguel
 Date:	        March 12, 2010
</span>
 Re:	          Health Care Update &amp; Blue Dog Analysis

        This memorandum provides a brief status update on the Congressional
  debate over health care reform.

        As discussed below, the House is in the midst of charting the course forward
  on health care reform.

        On May 12, 2009, the Blue Dog Coalition released their principles for health
  care reform. In addition to providing a brief summary of the current state of play
  on health care, this memorandum also outlines those principles and demonstrates
  how the President's health reform proposal meets the Coalition's goals. Talking

  points for use in a conversation with	           and other Blue Dog Coalition
  members are part of this analysis.

  I. BACKGROUND

        The House is positioning for a final vote on health care reform legislation as

  soon as next week, though it is still unclear that they will be able to secure the 216
  members needed to pass the measure.

        CB0 scores of the final bill are expected today (Friday, March 12t  h).

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768791 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

 II.   BLUE DOG ANALYSIS AND TALKING POINTS

       On May 12, 2009 the Blue Dog Coalition released their principles for health
 care reform. The analysis below outlines those principles and demonstrates how
 the health reform Proposal meets almost all of these goals.

                                          (2)

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768791 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

        A.	    Controlling Costs

     •  Blue Dog Principle:    Comprehensive health care reform must be deficit
        neutral. Finding savings within the current health care system is a critical
        first step to achieving this goal.

        President's Proposal:    The Proposal is not only deficit neutral, but
        according to the Congressional Budget Office, it will reduce the deficit by
        roughly $100 billion by 2019 and about $1 trillion in the second decade.

     •  Blue Dog Principle:    Payment incentives should be realigned to improve the
        quality of patient care and reduce inefficiencies.

        President's Proposal:    The Proposal includes many significant policies that
        will realign payments to emphasize quality and efficiency. These include:

         o  Establishing Value-Based Purchasing Programs: The Proposal
            establishes a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital
            services linking Medicare payments to performance measures for
            common, high-cost conditions such as cardiac, surgical and pneumonia

            care. Beginning in FY 2014, other Medicare providers including long
            term care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and hospice will
            participate in the program. Providers who do not participate will be
            penalized. In addition, the Secretary of HUB is required to submit a plan

            to Congress on how to move skilled nursing facilities and home health
            agencies into a value-based purchasing payment system.

         o  Addressing Geographic Inequities: The Proposal also begins to address

            geographic inequities by directing the Secretary of HHS to develop and
            implement a budget-neutral payment system that will adjust Medicare
            physician payments based on the quality and cost of the care they deliver.
            Quality and cost measures will be risk-adjusted and geographically

            standardized. The new payment system will then be phased-in over a 2-
            year period beginning in 2015.

         o  Extending and Expanding Physician Quality Reporting: The Proposal

            extends the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) program
            through 2014. This program provides incentives to physicians who

                                            (3)

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768791 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

           report Medicare quality data. Beginning in 2014, physicians who do not
           report their data will have their payments reduced.

        o  Creating a National Pilot Program on Bundling Payments: The Proposal
           establishes a national pilot program on payment bundling and allows the
           Secretary of EIFIS to increase the scale and scope of the program if

           certain cost and quality goals are met.

        o  Providing Physicians with Improved Feedback Information: The
           Proposal expands the Medicare physician resource use feedback program

           to provide for the development of individualized reports so physicians
           can compare their per capita utilization to other physicians in their area.

        o  Reducing Payments to Hospitals with High Rate of Hospital Acquired

           Infections: The Proposal reduces Medicare payments to hospitals with
           high rates of hospital acquired infections for certain high-cost and
           common conditions. In addition, the plan requires the Secretary of HHS

           to submit a report to Congress on the appropriateness of establishing a
           healthcare acquired condition policy for other Medicare providers
           including skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-
           term care hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers and others.

        o  Promoting Accountable Care Organizations: The Proposal rewards
           Accountable Care Organizations (AC0s) that take responsibility for the
           costs and quality of care received by their patient panel over time. ACOs
           that meet quality-of-care targets and reduce the costs of their patients

           relative to a spending benchmark are rewarded with a share of the
           savings they achieve for the Medicare program.

        o Reducing Payments to Hospitals for Preventable Readmissions: The

           Proposal reduces payments to hospitals for potentially preventable
           Medicare readmissions for the three conditions with risk adjusted
           readmission measures that are currently endorsed by,the National Quality
           Forum (NQF). Under the Proposal, the Secretary of IIHS has the

           authority to expand the policy to additional conditions in future years and
           directs the Secretary to calculate and make publicly available information
           on all patient hospital readmission rates for certain conditions.

        o  Establishing a CMS Center for Innovation: The Proposal establishes a
           Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Innovation within the Centers for

                                           (4)

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768791 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

           Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) at HHS. The Innovation Center
           will research, develop, test, and expand innovative payment and delivery
           arrangements to improve the quality and reduce the cost of care provided
            to patients in each program. Innovations that are found to work could

            then be rapidly expanded and applied more broadly—helping to
            transform the health care system into one that provides better care at
            lower cost.

     •  Blue Dog Principle:    Public reporting of the costs and quality of care
        should be examined to increase transparency.

        President's Proposal:    The Proposal includes several provisions to increase
        transparency for both costs and quality of care. These include:

        o Allowing Private Sector Purchasers to Obtain Medicare Data to Measure
            Provider/Supplier Performance:   The Proposal authorizes the release and
            use of standardized extracts of Medicare claims data to measure the
            performance of providers and suppliers in ways that protect patient
            privacy. Employers have argued for years that they need this type of
            data to ensure that they are driving quality and efficiency in the health

            plans in which their workers participate, and the Proposal finally
            establishes a pathway for this to occur.

        o Establishing Medical Reimbursement Data Centers:       The Proposal
            authorizes the establishment of medical reimbursement data centers to

            develop fee schedules and other database tools that reflect market rates
            for medical services in various geographic areas. These Centers will also
            make health care cost information readily available to the public on the
            interne.

         o Requiring Hospitals to Publish a List of Standard Charges:    The Proposal

            requires hospitals to annually publish a list of the hospital's standard
            charges for items and services provided, including diagnosis related
            groups (DRGs), the standard unit that hospitals use to bill Medicare and
            other payors for inpatient services.

     •   Blue Dog Principle:   Medicare, Medicaid and    CHIP   program integrity
         should be strengthened by reducing waste, fraud and abuse.

                                           (5)

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768791 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

        President's Proposal: The Proposal includes an unprecedented number of

        fraud and abuse policies:

        o Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP Program Integrity Provisions:      The
           Secretary will establish procedures to screen high-risk providers and
           suppliers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. Providers and

           suppliers enrolling or re-enrolling will be subject to new requirements
           including a compliance program, disclosure of current or previous
           affiliations with any provider or supplier that has uncollected debt, has
           had their payments suspended, has been excluded from participating in a
           Federal health care program, or has had their billing privileges revoked.
           The Secretary is authorized to deny enrollment in these programs if these

           affiliations pose an undue risk.

        o  Enhanced Medicare and Medicaid Program Integrity Provisions:      New
           penalties will exclude individuals who order or prescribe an item or
           service, make false Statements on applications or contracts to participate
           in a Federal health care program, or who know of an overpayment and do

           not return the overpayment. Each violation would be subject to a fine of
           up to $50,000. The Secretary may suspend payments to a provider or
           supplier pending a fraud investigation. Health Care Fraud and Abuse
           Control (HCFAC) funding will be increased by $10 million each year for
           fiscal years 2011 through 2020. The Secretary will establish a national
           health care fraud and abuse data collection program for reporting adverse

           actions taken against health care providers, suppliers, and practitioners,
           and submit information on the actions to the National Practitioner Data
           Bank (NPDB). The Secretary will have the authority to disenroll a
           Medicare enrolled physician or supplier who fails to maintain and
           provide access to written orders or requests for payment for durable
           medical equipment (DME), certification for home health services, or

           referrals for other items and services. The HI-IS Secretary will expand the
           number of areas to be included in round two of the DME competitive
           bidding program from 79 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas
           (MSAs) to 100 of the largest MSAs, and to use competitively bid prices
           in all areas by 2016.

        o Additional Medicaid Program Integrity Provisions:    States will be
           required to terminate individuals or entities from their Medicaid
           programs if the individuals or entities were terminated from Medicare or

                                          (6)

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768791 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

           another State's Medicaid program. Medicaid agencies will be required to
           exclude individuals or entities from participating in Medicaid for a
           specified period of time if the entity or individual owns, controls, or
           manages an entity that: (1) has failed to repay overpayments; (2) is
           suspended, excluded, or terminated from participation in any Medicaid

            program; or (3) is affiliated with an individual or entity that has been
            suspended, excluded, or terminated from Medicaid participation. Agents,
            clearinghouses, or other payees that submit claims on behalf of health
            care providers must register with the State and the Secretary. States and
            Medicaid managed care entities must submit data elements for program

            integrity, oversight, and administration. States must not make any
            payments for items or services to any financial institution or entity
            located outside of the United States.

        o In addition, the President's Proposal incorporates a number of additional

            proposals that are either part of the Administration's FY 2011 Budget
            Proposal or were included in Republican plans. These include:

            •  Comprehensive Sanctions Database.      The Proposal establishes  a
               comprehensive Medicare and Medicaid sanctions database, overseen
               by the HHS Inspector General. This database will provide a central

               storage location, allowing for law enforcement access to information
               related to past sanctions on health care providers, suppliers and related
               entities. (Source: H.R. 3400, "Empowering Patients First Act"
               (Republican Study Committee Proposal))

            •  Registration and Background Checks of Billing Agencies and
               Individuals. In an effort to decrease dishonest billing practices in the
               Medicare program, the Proposal will assist in reducing the number of
               individuals and agencies with a history of fraudulent activities
               participating in Federal health care programs. It ensures that entities

               that Proposal for Medicare on behalf of providers are in good
               standing. It also strengthens the Secretary's ability to exclude from
               Medicare individuals who knowingly submit false or fraudulent
                claims. (Source: H.R. 3970, "Medical Rights &amp; Reform Act")

            •   Expanded Access to the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data

                Bank   Increasing access to the health care integrity data bank will
                improve coordination and information sharing in anti-fraud efforts.
                The Proposal broadens access to the data bank to quality control and

                                            (7 )

               peer review organizations and private plans that are involved in

               furnishing items or services reimbursed by Federal health care
               program. It includes criminal penalties for misuse. (Source: H.R.
               3970, "Medical Rights &amp; Reform Act")

            •  Liability of Medicare Administrative Contractors for Claims
                                                   In attacking fraud, it is critical to
               Submitted by Excluded Providers.
               ensure the contractors that are paying claims are doing their utmost to
               ensure excluded providers do not receive Medicare payments.
               Therefore, the Proposal holds Medicare Administrative Contractors
               accountable for Federal payment for individuals or entities excluded
               from the Federal programs or items or services for which payment is

               denied. (Source: H.R. 3970, "Medical Rights &amp; Reform Act")

            •  Community Mental Health Centers.      The Proposal ensures that
               individuals have access to comprehensive mental health services in
               the community setting, but strengthens standards for facilities that
               seek reimbursement as community mental health centers by ensuring

               these facilities are not taking advantage of Medicare patients or the
               taxpayers. (Source: H.R. 3970, "Medical Rights &amp; Reform Act")

            •  Limiting Debt Discharge in Bankruptcies of Fraudulent Health Care
               Providers or Suppliers.  The Proposal will assist in recovering
               overpayments made to providers and suppliers and return such funds

               to the Medicare Trust Fund. It prevents fraudulent health care
               providers from discharging through bankruptcy amounts due to the
               Secretary from overpayments. (Source: H.R. 3970, "Medical Rights
               &amp; Reform Act")

            •  Use of Technology for Real-Time Data Review.      The Proposal speeds

               access to claims data to identify potentially fraudulent payments more
               quickly. It establishes a system for using technology to provide real-
               time data analysis of claim and payments under public programs to
               identify and stop waste, fraud and abuse. (Source: Roskam

            •  Illegal Distribution of a Medicare or Medicaid Beneficiary
               Identification or Billing Privileges. Fraudulent billing costs taxpayers
               millions of dollars each year. Individuals looking to gain access to a
               beneficiary's personal information approach Medicare and Medicaid

                                            (8)

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768791 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

               beneficiaries with false incentives. Many beneficiaries unwittingly
               give over this personal information without ever receiving promised

               services. The Proposal adds strong sanctions, including jail time, for
               individuals who purchase, sell or distribute Medicare beneficiary
               identification numbers or billing privileges under Medicare or
               Medicaid — if done knowingly, intentionally, and with intent to
               defraud. (Source: H.R. 3970, "Medical Rights &amp; Reform Act")

           •   Study of Universal Product Numbers Claims Forms for Selected Items
               and Services Under the Medicare Program. The Proposal requires
               HHS to study and issue a report to Congress that examines the costs
               and benefits of assigning universal product numbers (UPNs) to
               selected items and services reimbursed under Medicare. The report

               must examine whether UPNs could help improve the efficient
               operation of Medicare and its ability to detect fraud and abuse.

               Amendment offered in House Ways &amp; Means Committee markup)

           •   Medicaid Prescription Drug Profiling.   The Proposal requires States to

               monitor and remediate high-risk billing activity, not limited to
               prescription drug classes involving a high volume of claims, to
               improve Medicaid integrity and beneficiary quality of care. States
               may choose one or more drug classes and must develop or review and
               update their care Proposal to reduce utilization and remediate any
              preventable episodes of care where possible. Requiring States to
               monitor high-risk billing activity to identify prescribing and utilization

              patterns that may indicate abuse or excessive prescription drug
               utilization will assist in improving Medicaid program integrity and
               save taxpayer dollars. (Source: President's FY 2011 Budget)

           •   Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Errors. The Proposal requires

               in statute that the HES Secretary extrapolate the error rate found in
              the risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to the entire
              Medicare Advantage (MA) contract payment for a given year when
              recouping overpayments. Extrapolating risk score errors in MA
              Proposals is consistent with the methodology used in the Medicare
              fee-for-service program and enables Medicare to recover risk
              adjustment overpayments. MA plans have an incentive to report more

              sever beneficiary diagnoses than are justified because they receive

                                           (9)

              Budget)

           • Mod CertaCertain Medicare Medical Review Limitations.    The Medicare
              Modernization Act of 2003 placed certain limitations on the type of

              review that could be conducted by Medicare Administrative
              Contractors prior to the payment of Medicare Part A and B claims.
              The Proposal modifies these statutory provisions that currently limit
              random medical review and place statutory limitations on the
              application of Medicare prepayment review. Modifying certain

              medical review limitations will give Medicare contractors better and
              more efficient access to medical records and claims, which helps to
              reduce waste, fraud and abuse. (Source: President's FY 2011
              Budget)

           • Establish a CMS-IRS Data Match to Ident0; Fraudulent Providers.

              The Proposal authorizes the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
              Services (CMS) to work collaboratively with the Internal Revenue
              Service (IRS) to determine which providers have not filed Federal tax
              returns to help identify potentially fraudulent providers sooner. The
              data match will primarily target certain high-risk provider types in

              high-vulnerability areas. This proposal also enables both IRS and
              Medicare to recoup any monies owed to the Federal government
              through this program. By requiring the Internal Revenue Service
              (IRS) to disclose to CMS those entities that have evaded filing taxes
              and matching the data against provider billing data, this proposal will
              enable CMS to better detect fraudulent providers billing the Medicare

              program. (Source: President's FY 2011 Budget)

           •   Undercover Health Professionals to Weed out Fraud and Abuse. The
              Proposal includes a provision to allow medical professionals to
              conduct random undercover investigations of health care providers

              that receive reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, and other
               Federal programs. (Source: Senator Coburn Amendment #87 during

     •  Blue Dog Principle:    The role of primary care providers should be
        strengthened and prioritized. Patient care should be coordinated across
        settings and focus on the entire course of a patient's illness.

     sf President's Proposal:   The Proposal includes a number of provisions to
        strengthen the role of primary care providers and encourage the coordination
        of care across different settings. These include:

        o Promoting Accountable Care Organizations: The Proposal rewards

           Accountable Care Organizations (AC0s) that take responsibility for the
           costs and quality of care received by their patient panel over time. ACOs
           that meet quality-of-care targets and reduce the costs of their patients
           relative to a spending benchmark are rewarded with a share of the
           savings they achieve for the Medicare program.

        o Supporting Primary Care Teams: The Proposal includes a new
           demonstration program for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries will test
           payment incentives and integrated service delivery models relying on
           physician and nurse practitioner-directed home-based primary care
           teams.

        o  Creating a Primary Care Extension Program: The Proposal creates a
           primary care extension program to educate and provide technical
           assistance to primary care providers about evidence-based therapies,
           preventive medicine, health promotion, chronic disease management, and
           mental health.

        o Supporting Patient-Centered Medical Homes: The Proposal creates a
           program to establish and fund the development of community health
           teams to support the development of medical homes by increasing access
           to comprehensive, community based, coordinated care.

        o  Expanding Access to Primary Care Services and General Surgery
           Services: The Proposal provides primary care practitioners, as well as
           general surgeons practicing in health professional shortage areas, with a
           10 percent Medicare payment bonus for five years.

    •   Blue Dog Principle:   Financial incentives should be implemented to
        encourage beneficiaries to follow recommended prevention and wellness
        services.

        President's Proposal:   The Proposal includes several provisions to

        incentivize individuals and Medicare beneficiaries to follow recommended
        prevention and wellness services.

        o  The Proposal expands proven employer-wellness programs by allowing
           employers to vary premiums by up to 30 percent for employee

           participation in certain health promotion and disease prevention
           programs.

        o  Under the Proposal, Medicare beneficiaries will not have to pay
           coinsurance (including co-pays and deductibles) for preventive services

           delivered in all settings.

        o The Proposal provides coverage under Medicare, with no co-payment or
           deductible, for an annual wellness visit and personalized prevention plan
           services, including a comprehensive health risk assessment, such as:

           • A five- to ten-year screening schedule;
           • A list of identified risk factors and conditions and a strategy to address
               them;
           • Health advice and referral to education and preventive counseling;
               and

            • Community-based interventions to address modifiable risk factors
               such as physical activity, smoking, and nutrition.

     •  Blue Dog Principle:    Additional investment should be made to research

        cures and improve treatments for health conditions.

        President's Proposal:    The Proposal authorizes the Cures Acceleration
        Network, within the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to award grants and
        contracts to develop cures and treatments of diseases. In addition, the

        Proposal includes a two-year temporary credit subject to an overall cap of $1
        billion to encourage investments in new therapies to prevent, diagnose, and
        treat acute and chronic diseases.

        C. Improving Access

     •  Blue Dog Principle:    Individual and small businesses should be provided
        with a targeted tax credit to use toward the cost of health care coverage.

        President's Proposal:
           o Individuals and families:  The Proposal provides refundable tax
               credits for Americans with incomes up to 400 percent of poverty (up
               to about $88,000/year for a family of four) to purchase coverage

               through the Exchange. The credit will be calculated on a sliding scale
               beginning at 2 percent of income for those at 100 percent of poverty
               and phasing out at 9.5 percent of income between 300-400 percent of
               poverty.

           o Small businesses:   The Proposal provides $40 billion in tax credits to
               help small businesses purchase coverage for their employees. Under
               the provision, small businesses with fewer than 26 workers and
               average annual wages of less than $50,000 with a sliding scale tax
               credit of up to 50 percent of the employer contribution toward the

               total premium cost. Tax-exempt small businesses meeting similar
               requirements are also eligible for tax credits.

     •  Blue Dog Principle:
                               Payments to rural health care providers and
        community health centers should be modernized in order to meet the unique
        challenges that these entities face.

        President's Proposal:    The Proposal extends a number of important
        provisions to maintain access to essential services for beneficiaries in rural

        areas.
           o Community health centers:     The Proposal invests an unprecedented
               $11 billion in community health centers, recognizing the critical role
              they play in providing quality care in underserved areas. About 1,250
               centers provide care to 20 million people, with an emphasis on

              preventive and primary care.

           o Physician payments in rural areas:   The Proposal extends the floor on
               geographic adjustments to Medicare physician payments in rural areas
               to more appropriately reflect practice costs.

           o Outpatient protections:  The Proposal extends the outpatient hospital

               "hold harmless" provision, allowing small rural hospitals and sole
               community hospitals to receive this adjustment through FY2010.

           o   Rural Community Hospital Demonstration:     The Proposal extends the
               Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program for five years and

               expands eligible sites to additional States and hospitals.

     •  Blue Dog Principle: Loan assistance and forgiveness programs should be
        improved to increase the number of physicians, nurses and other health care

        professionals in rural and underserved areas.

        President's Proposal:   The Proposal creates, expands, and improves several
        health care workforce programs. These include:

        o National Health Service Corps:
                                            The Proposal reauthorizes and
           appropriates funding for to the National Health Service Corps, which
           provides scholarships and loan repayment for clinicians who provide
           medical, dental, and mental health care in urban and rural Health
           Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) throughout the country. The
           Proposal also increases the loan repayment benefits for each Corps

           member.

        o  Health Professions Education and Training in Primary Care, Pediatrics,
           and Dentistry: The Proposal establishes a primary care training and
           capacity building program, and it enhances faculty development in

           primary care and physician assistant programs. The Proposal eases
           current criteria for schools and students to qualify for loans, establishes a
           grant program to help eligible entities recruit students most likely to
           practice medicine in underserved rural communities, and supports dental
           education and training. The Proposal also establishes a loan repayment

           program for pediatric subspecialists and providers of mental and
           behavioral health services to children and adolescents who work in
           underserved areas or with underserved populations.

        o  Nursing Education and Training: The Proposal awards grants to nursing
           schools to strengthen nurse education and training programs and to
           improve nurse retention, increases nurse student loan amounts, and
           addresses nurse faculty shortages by making nurse faculty eligible for
           loan repayment and scholarship programs and reauthorizing the nurse

           faculty loan program.

        o  Public Health Workforce: The Proposal establishes a Public Health
           Workforce Recruitment and Retention Program Corps to address public
           health workforce shortages, provides funding to support training of the

           public health workforce and preventive medicine physicians, establishes
           a Ready Reserve Corps within the Commissioned Corps for service in
           times of national emergency, supports fellowship training in public
           health, and authorizes grants to promote the community health
            workforce.

     •  Blue Dog Principle:    Access to telemedicine programs should be promoted
        and expanded

        President's Proposal:    The new CMS Center for Innovation has broad
        authority to search, develop, test, and expand innovative payment and
        delivery arrangements to improve the quality and reduce the cost of care
        provided to patients in each program. The Proposal specifically directs the
        Center for Innovation to consider testing telehealth expansions.

     •  Blue Dog Principle:    The ability of insurance companies to deny coverage
        to individuals with pre-existing conditions should be eliminated.

        President's Proposal:    The Proposal prohibits denials of coverage based on

        pre-existing conditions for children within months of passage. Starting in
        2014, the Proposal prohibits all denials of coverage based on pre-existing
        conditions.

     •   Blue Dog Principle:   Access to long-term care services should be improved
         Patients should be provided with the option of home-or community-based
         care, along with increased efforts to educate the public about end of life
         care and long-term care insurance.

        President's Proposal:    The Proposal includes several provisions to improve
        access to long-term care services, including home and community-based
        care.

        o CLASS Act for voluntary long-term care insurance: The Proposal creates
           a voluntary long-term care insurance program, which will provide a cash
           benefit to help seniors and people with disabilities obtain services and
           supports that will enable them to remain in their homes and communities.
           The Proposal will include a number of improvements that ensure that the

           program is financially and actuarially sound.

        o "Community First Choice" Option for People with Disabilities: A new
           optional Medicaid benefit will be created through which States may offer
           community-based attendant services and supports to Medicaid

           beneficiaries (&lt;150% of poverty) with disabilities who would otherwise
           require care in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility for
           the mentally retarded.

        o Additional Long-Term Care Options: A number of new State options

           would be created including: allowing States to provide home- and
            community-based services (HCBS) and full Medicaid benefits to people
           with long-term care needs; extending the "Money Follows the Person"
            rebalancing demonstration; protecting recipients of home- and
            community-based services against spousal impoverishment; and
            increases funding for State Aging and Disability Resource Centers. The

            Proposal also removes barriers to providing HCBS by giving States the
            option to provide more types of HCBS through a State plan amendment
            to individuals with higher levels of need, rather than through a waiver,
            and to extend full Medicaid benefits to individuals receiving HCBS under
            a State plan amendment.

 OECD — Paris, 5 December 2011

                 G overnm ents m ust tackle record gap betw een rich and poor, says O EC D

 The gap between rich and poor   inOECD countries has reached    itshighest level for over 30 years, and
 governments must act quickly to tackle inequality, according to a new OECD report.

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784429 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

                                         "Divided We Stand: Why Inequality Keeps Rising" finds that
                                         the average income of the richest 10% is now about nine
                                         times that of the poorest 10 % across the OECD.

                                         The income gap has risen even in traditionally egalitarian
                                         countries, such as Germany, Denmark and Sweden, from 5
                                         to 1 in the 1980s to 6 to 1 today. The gap is 10 to 1 in Italy,
                                         to 1 in Israel, Turkey and the United States.er still, at 14

                                         In Chile and Mexico, the incomes of the richest are still more
than 25 times those of the poorest, the highest in the OECD, but this gap has finally started dropping.

Income inequality is much higher in some major emerging economies outside the OECD area. At 50 to 1,
Brazil's income gap remains much higher than in many other countries, although it has been falling significantly
over the past decade.

                    Income inequality increased in most, but not all OECDcountries

Launching the report in Paris, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria said "The social contract is starting to
unravel in many countries. This study dispels the assumptions that the benefits of economic growth will
automatically trickle down to the disadvantaged and that greater inequality fosters greater social mobility.
Without a comprehensive strategy for inclusive growth, inequality will likely continue to rise."

The main driver behind rising income gaps has been greater inequality in wages and salaries, as the high-
skilled have benefitted more from technological progress than the low-skilled. Reforms to boost competition
and to make labour markets more adaptable, for example by promoting part-time work or more flexible hours,
have promoted productivity and brought more people into work, especially women and low-paid workers. But
the rise in part-time and low-paid work also extended the wage gap.

Tax and benefit systems play a major role in reducing market-driven inequality, but have become less effective
at redistributing income since the mid-1990s. The main reason lies on the benefits side: benefits levels fell in
nearly all OECD countries, eligibility rules were tightened to contain spending on social protection, and
transfers to the poorest failed to keep pace with earnings growth.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784429 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

As a result, the benefit system in most countries has become less effective in reducing inequalities over the

past 15. years.

Another factor has been a cut in top tax rates for high-earners.

"There is nothing inevitable about high and growing inequalities," said Mr Gurria. "Our report clearly indicates
that upskilling of the workforce is by far the most powerful instrument to counter rising income inequality. The
investment in people must begin in early childhood and be followed through into formal education and work."

The OECD underlines the need for governments to review their tax systems to ensure that wealthier
individuals contribute their fair share of the tax burden. This can be achieved by raising marginal tax rates on
the rich but also improving tax compliance, eliminating tax deductions, and reassessing the role of taxes in all

forms of property and wealth, the report says.

Subject:  Saudi Arabia, UAE funded jihadi networks in Pakistan-WikiLeaks (Reuters)
</span>

May 22 (Reuters) - Islamic charities from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates financed a network in
U.S. ally Pakistan that recruited children as young as eight to wage holy war, a local newspaper reported on
Sunday, citing Wikileaks.

    A U.S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks said financial support estimated at $100 million a year was
making its way from those Gulf Arab states to a jihadist recruitment network in Pakistan's Punjab province,

Dawn newspaper reported.

    The November 2008 dispatch by Bryan Hunt, the then principal officer at the U.S. consulate in Lahore, was

based on discussions with local government and non-governmental sources during trips to Punjab, Pakistan's
most populous province.

    It said those sources claimed that financial aid from Saudi and United Arab Emirates was coming from

"missionary" and "Islamic charitable" organisations ostensibly with the direct support of those countries'
governments.

    Saudi Arabia, the United States and Pakistan heavily supported the Afghan mujahideen against Soviet
 occupation troops in the 1980s.

    Militancy subsequently mushroomed in the region and militants moved to Pakistan's northwest tribal areas
 along the border with Afghanistan, seen as a global hub for militants.

    Since then there has been a growing nexus between militant groups there and in Punjab. In recent years

 militants have been carrying out suicide bombings seemingly at will in Pakistan, despite military offensives
 against their strongholds.

Subject: UN's Pillay: Yemen peace-deal amnesty may be unlawful (Reuters)
</span>
GENEVA (Reuters) -     Granting amnesty to perpetrators of war crimes and human rights absuses under Yemen's
presidential power transition deal would be against international law, the United Nations human rights chief
said on Friday, undermining the peace agreement.

   "I have been closely following the events in Yemen, particularly the very contentious debate about an
amnesty law to be presented to Parliament shortly," U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay
said in a statement.

    Pillay has previously blamed Yemeni government forces for using live ammunition against unarmed
protesters and has said President Ali Abdullah Saleh should not get amnesty in a deal to persuade him to leave
power.

    "International law and the U.N. policy are clear on the matter: amnesties are not permissible if they prevent
the prosecution of individuals who may be criminally responsible for international crimes including war crimes,
crimes against humanity, genocide, and gross violations of human rights."

    Rupert Colville, a spokesman for Pillay in Geneva, declined to elaborate further or say who might face
which charges.

    A source in the cabinet, which discussed the draft law this week, has said in its present form the amnesty
would grant immunity widely to Saleh's aides and allies.

    "Based on information we have gathered, there is reason to believe that some of these crimes were
 committed in Yemen during the period for which an amnesty is under consideration. Such an amnesty would be
 in violation of Yemen's international human rights obligations," Pillay said.

    She also said any legislation must not discriminate between individuals who are pro-government or in
 opposition.

    Saleh has repeatedly refused to accept deals brokered to encourage him to leave power after 33 years. As
 well as facing 11 months of "Arab Spring" protests that have pushed Yemen to the brink of civil war, his forces
 have been battling Islamic militants who have seized several towns.

                      says the militants are linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based regional wing, which the United
    The government
 States and has called the most dangerous branch of the militant network. But his opponents have accused him of
 ceding territory to Islamists to bolster his assertion that his rule keeps al Qaeda in check.

   Washington and oil giant Saudi Arabia fear uncertainty over Saleh's fate may push the country into chaos

and help al Qaeda.

   Saudi Arabia has supported Saleh by donating diesel and crude oil and the United States, which long backed

Saleh as a pillar of its "counter-terrorism" strategy, helped craft the power transition deal giving him immunity
from prosecution.

Here's the New York Times version of the Post piece: lots of press on the Shindell article. The article cites Nordhaus and

Shellenberger of the Breakthrough Institute and their Climate Pragmatism paper, which endorses a focus on actions that
are beneficial for both climate and air quality/health.

Climate Proposal Puts Practicality

Ahead of Sacrifice

By JOHN TIERNEY

The current issue of the journal Science containa proposalto slow global warming that is

extraordinary for a couple of reasons:

1.In theory, it would help people living in poor countries now, instead of mainly benefiting

their descendants.

2.In practice, it might actually work.

This proposal comes from an international team of researchers — in climate modeling,
atmospheric chemistry, economics, agriculture and public health — who started off with a

question that borders on heresy in some green circles: Could something be done about global

warming besides forcing everyone around the world to use less fossil fuel?

Ever since the Kyoto Protocolimposed restrictions in industrial countries, the first priority of

environmentalists has been to further limit the emission of carbon dioxide. Burning fewer

fossil fuels is the most obvious way to counteract the greenhouse effect, and the notion has
always had a wonderfully virtuous political appeal — as long as it's being done by someone

else.

But as soon as people are asked to do it themselves, they follow a principle identified by

Roger Pielke Jr. in his book"The Climate Fix."Dr. Pielke, a political scientist at the

University of Colorado, calls it iron law of climate policy: When there's a conflict between
 policies promoting economic growth and policies restricting carbon dioxide, economic growth

wins every time.

The law holds even in the most ecologically correct countries of Europe, as Dr. Pielke found

 by looking at carbon reductions from 1990 until010.

 The Kyoto Protocol was supposed to put Europe on a new energy path, but it contained so

 many loopholes that the rate of "decarbonization" in Europe did not improve in the years

 after 1998, when the protocol was signed, or aft2002, when it was ratified. In fact, Europe's
 economy became more carbon-intensive in   2010, he says — a trend that seems likely to

 continue as nuclear power plants are shut down in Germany and replaced by coal-burning

 ones.

 "People will make trade-offs, but the one thing that won't be traded off is keeping the lights

 on at reasonable cost," he says. Given the reluctance of affluent Europeans to make sacrifices,

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05788999 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

what are the odds of persuading billions of people in poorer countries to pay more for energy

today in return for a cooler climate at the end of the century?

But suppose they were offered a deal with immediate benefits, like the one proposed in
Science by researchers in the United States, Britain, Italy, Austria, Thailand and Kenya. The

team looked at ways to slow global warming while also reducing the soot and smog that are

damaging agriculture and health.

Black carbon, the technical term for the soot spewed from diesel engines and traditional

cookstoves and kilns, has been blamed for a significant portion of the recent warming in the

Arctic and for shrinking glaciers in the Himalayas. Snow ordinarily reflects the sun's rays, but

when the white landscape is covered with soot, the darker surface absorbs heat instead.

Methane, which is released from farms, landfills, coal mines and petroleum operations,
contributes to ground-level ozone associated with smog and poorer yields from crops. It's also

a greenhouse gas that, pound for pound, is far more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping

the sun's heat.

After looking at hundreds of ways to control these pollutants, the researchers determined the

14 most effective measures for reducing climate change, like encouraging a switch to cleaner

diesel engines and cookstoves, building more efficient kilns and coke ovens, capturing
methane at landfills and oil wells, and reducing methane emissions from rice paddies by

draining them more often.

If these strategies became widespread, the researchers calculate, the amount of global

warming in 2050 would be reduced by about one degree Fahrenheit, roughly a third of the

warming projected if nothing is done. This impact on temperatures in 2050 would be

significantly larger than the projected impact of the commonly proposed measures for
reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

Not incidentally, the researchers calculate, these reductions in.low-level ozone and black
carbon would yield lots of benefits long before 2050. Because people would be breathing

cleaner air, 700,000 to 4.7 million premature deaths would be avoided each year. Thanks to

improved crop yields, farmers would produce at least 3o million more metric tons of food

annually.

"The beauty of these pollution-control measures is that over five to 10 years they pay for

themselves in the developing world," says Drew Shindell, the lead author of the proposal, who
is a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and at Columbia

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05788999 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

University. "They slow global warming, but there are local benefits, too. If you make black

carbon reductions in China or India, you get most of the benefits in China or India."

These ideas already have a few fans, including Ted Nordhaus, a founder of the Breakthrough
Institute, which has endorsed similar measures in a report called "Climate Pragmatism." Mr.

Nordhaus sees the Science paper as a modelforthefuture.

"Thisiswhatthepost-Kyotoworldwill looklike,"hesays. "We'll increasinglybemanaging

ecological problems likeglobal warming, not solvingthem. Wemaymakesomeheadwayin

limitingour emissions, but if we dosoit will be throughinnovatingbetter energy

technologies andimplementing themat the national andregional level, not throughtop-

downinternational limits."

Thesepollution-control policies aren't especiallycontroversial —evenRepublicans hostileto
environmentalistshavesupportedresearchintoblackcarbon—but neitherhavetheyhave

beenespeciallypopular. Mainstreamenvironmental groups haven't put themonthe agenda.

Onereasonis thelackof glamour: Encouragingvillagers tousediesel enginefilters anddrain

their rice paddiesis less newsworthy than negotiating a global treaty on carbon at a United

Nations conference.

Another reason is the fear of distracting people from the campaign against carbon dioxide,
the gas with the most long-term impact. Because it lingers in the atmosphere much longer

than soot or methane, some scientists argue that limiting it must be the first step. Dr. Shindell

says he agrees with the need to limit carbon dioxide and sympathizes with those who worry

about losing focus.

"But I also worry that carbon dioxide will go up even if we do focus on it," he says. "We're at a

complete deadlock on carbon dioxide. Dealing with the short-lived pollutants might really be

a way to bridge some of the differences, both between the two sides in the United States and
between the developed and the developing world."

No matter what people think about global warming, there aren't a lot of fans of dirty snow,

poor crops and diseased lungs.

A Second Front in the Climate War

Year after year, the world's nations gather to find ways to reduce carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, with little meaningful

progress. Frustrated by this slow pace,he United States and five other countries announced this weeka modest but potentially game-

changing initiative to cut three other pollutants that also contribute significantly to climate change.

The three pollutants — methane, soot (also known as black carbon) and hydrofluorocarbons — together account for about 3o percent to

4o percent of the rise in global temperatures. Unlike carbon dioxide, they do not remain in the atmosphere for a long time, but, while

they are there, they drive temperatures upward.

Mainstream scientists believe that to avoid disastrous increases in the sea levels and widespread drought, the rise in global

temperatures by 2050 should not exceed  2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Though cuts in carbon dioxide will also be
necessary to reach that goal, curbing these three pollutants will help enormously.

Officials hope further that by tackling these pollutants they can achieve relatively quick and measurable reductions in emissions without

waiting for politicians to act or the United Nations process to produce a global agreement on carbon dioxide.

The plan's founding members are the United States, Canada, Sweden, Mexico, Ghana and Bangladesh. Washington and Ottawa will

jointly underwrite a $1.5 million start-up fund. Clearly, the program must be scaled up over time, with many more countries

participating. In the short term, officials say their purpose is to educate and test inexpensive and technologically accessible ways of

capturing these gases.

Soot, a huge health hazard, can be reduced by installing filters on diesel engines, replacing traditional cookstoves with more efficient

models and banning the open burning of agricultural waste. Methane can be captured from oil and gas wells, leaky pipelines, municipal
landfills and wastewater treatment plants.

Significantly reducing hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, could be harder. These compounds, widely used in air-conditioners and originally
 developed to replace the refrigerants that were damaging the ozone layer, turned out to be a potent greenhouse gas. Efforts to find less-

 harmful substitutes have met resistance from countries like India and China, where most HFCs are manufactured.

 Governments everywhere should obviously be pushing to reduce carbon dioxide, the most dangerous greenhouse gas. In the meantime,

 opening an important second front in the climate war will demonstrate that progress is possible.

                                           Monday, May 25, 2009

Purpose:     To reach out to Japan, South Korea, China and Russia following the probable May 24

DPRK nuclear test.

    •   A nuclear test by North Korea, if confirmed, would be a provocative act and an
        unequivocal violation of UNSCR 1718, blatantly disregarding the will of the international
        community.

    •   We have remained united in the face of the DPRK's provocations, and we need to

        maintain this unity among the Six-Party partners. The DPRK's message to us in advance
        of the test, which blamed the UNSC's "failure to apologize for its Presidential

        Statement," demonstrates the degree to which the DPRK has isolated itself. Now is the
        right time for a Five-Party meeting to demonstrate our unity.

    •   It is essential that the UN Security Council take strong measures to clearly demonstrate
        that the DPRK's actions will have consequences. The United States believes that it is

        essential that the Security Council issue a swift statement condemning the DPRK's test at
        its initial May 25 emergency meeting. The UNSC should then quickly follow up with a

        strong new Chapter 7 Resolution that includes concrete response measures.

   •  [FOR TOKYO AND SEOUL] The United States remains committed to the nuclear
      umbrella and its obligations under the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and

      Security and the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty.

national partnership
for women &amp; families

January 18, 2012

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton

via e-mail

Dear Madame Secretary:

As you may remember, each year the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families hosts a gala luncheon to honor
trailblazing leaders who have helped advance the role of women in the United States and worldwide, make our

workplaces more fair and family-friendly, and win quality, affordable health care for everyone. We had the great
privilege of honoring you at our luncheon in 1994 and I am writing to see if you would allow us to make you our honoree
and keynote speaker again in June, at our 2012 Annual Luncheon.

There is no more perfect honoree than you. You are a world leader with an illustrious career, exceptional achievements

in foreign policy, and have served as a lifelong role model for women and girls worldwide. We have watched with so
much pride as you broke barriers for women in government and politics, and cheered these last few years as you

skillfully steered the country's foreign policy, always making the rights and well-being of women and girls a centerpiece
of the nation's agenda. As a champion of women's rights and the power of women's voices, we so appreciate your
leadership in establishing the United States' first-ever National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security to formalize

the nation's commitment to promoting women's role in conflict prevention and resolution, protecting women from
gender-based violence and ensuring that women have equal access to relief and recovery assistance in war-torn and

violent areas of the world. You have transformed society with your tireless work to give women and girls in every corner
of the globe the chance to live free of violence, with comprehensive health services and real opportunities for education

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793365 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

and employment. Our daughters and their daughters will be so much better off because of your resolve and

contribution.

We would be immensely proud to have the chance to honor you in June. You may remember that our event brings
together more than 1,500 people from the women's, legal, business, public policy, civil rights, health, advocacy, and

labor communities here in Washington, D.C. We are currently planning to hold it on Friday, June 8, at the Washington
Hilton, but would be happy to adjust the date to accommodate your schedule.

In addition to you, President Clinton and Vice President Gore, our distinguished honorees over the years have included
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, journalist Christiane Amanpour, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, actor and

academic Anna Deavere Smith, as well as United Nations officials, pioneering civil rights attorneys, and luminaries from
numerous other fields.

Last year, the National Partnership turned 40. Like us, you remember that, when we opened our doors in 1971 as the
Women's Legal Defense Fund, women couldn't get credit cards or mortgages in their own names, job listings were

separated into jobs for men and jobs for women, and abortion was illegal in many states. We've been busy during those
years, helping to win the battles to outlaw pregnancy discrimination and sexual harassment, and, with your significant.

help, pass the Family and Medical Leave Act, undo the horrendous U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Ledbetter v. Goodyear,
pass health care reform, and much more.

We have been transforming public policies, changing business culture, and altering the way Americans see women's role
in families and in our society. Our work is not nearly done, but we are proud of the progress we've helped win over

these 40 years and ready for the challenges that lie ahead.

The National Partnership is the nation's preeminent voice on behalf of women and families. We work every day to build

a country where equal opportunity and women's rights are secure, no one experiences discrimination, all workplaces
are family-friendly, and every family has quality, affordable health care and real economic security. Our Annual

Luncheon is a time-honored Washington tradition and we could have no more appropriate honoree in 2012 than you.

The event begins with a VIP reception at 11:00 a.m. The luncheon portion begins at noon and ends by 2:00 p.m. The VIP

reception is for our speakers, major donors, members of Congress, members of the Administration, and other
distinguished guests. We would be delighted if you would be willing to attend for some portion of that time.

We look forward to your response. You can reach us by phone at         (202) 986 -2600 or by e -mail at
din	                           or jllichtman 	                           Please let us  know if we   can provide any  additional	       B6

information or materials.

A Second Front in the Climate War

Year after year, the world's nations gather to find ways to reduce carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, with little meaningful
                                                                                                 a modest but potentially game-
progress. Frustrated by this slow pace,e United States and five other countries announced this week
changing initiative to cut three other pollutants that also contribute significantly to climate change.

The three pollutants — methane, soot (also known as black carbon) and hydrofluorocarbons — together account for about 30 percent to

40 percent of the rise in global temperatures. Unlike carbon dioxide, they do not remain in the atmosphere for along time, but, while

they are there, they drive temperatures upward.

 Mainstream scientists believe that to avoid disastrous increases in the sea levels and widespread drought, the rise in global

 temperatures by 2050 should not exceed 2degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Though cuts in carbon dioxide will also be

 necessary to reach that goal, curbing these three pollutants will help enormously.

 Officials hope further that by tackling these pollutants they can achieve relatively quick and measurable reductions in emissions without
 waiting for politicians to act or the United Nations process to produce a global agreement on carbon dioxide.

 The plan's founding members are the United States, Canada, Sweden, Mexico, Ghana and Bangladesh. Washington and Ottawa will

 jointly underwrite a $15 million start-up fund. Clearly, the program must be scaled up overtime, with many more countries

 participating. In the short term, officials say their purpose is to educate and test inexpensive and technologically accessible ways of

 capturing these gases.

 Soot, a huge health hazard, can be reduced by installing filters on diesel engines, replacing traditional cookstoves with more efficient

 models and banning the open burning of agricultural waste. Methane can be captured from oil and gas wells, leaky pipelines, municipal

 landfills and wastewater treatment plants.

 Significantly reducing hydrofluorocarbons, or HFC,s, could be harder. These compounds, widely used in air-conditioners and originally
 developed to replace the refrigerants that were damaging the ozone layer, turned out to be a potent greenhouse gas. Efforts to find less-

 harmful substitutes have met resistance from counties like India and China, where most HFCs are manufactured.

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05794155 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

Governments everywhere should obviously be pushing to reduce carbon dioxide, the most dangerous greenhouse gas. In the meantime,

opening an important second front in the climate war will demonstrate that progress is possible.

Subject: Google Exec Chairman to Visit NKorea (AP)
</span>

SEOUL (AP) - Google's executive chairman is preparing to travel to one of the last frontiers of cyberspace:
North Korea.

Eric Schmidt will be traveling to North Korea on a private, humanitarian mission led by former New Mexico
Gov. Bill Richardson that could take place as early as this month, sources told The Associated Press on

Wednesday. The sources, two people familiar with the group's plans, asked not to be named because the visit
had not been made public.

The  trip would be the first by a top executive from U.S.-based Google, the world's largest Internet search

provider, to a country considered to have the most restrictive Internet policies on the planet.

North Korea is in the midst of what leader Kim Jong Un called a modern-day "industrial revolution" in a New

Year's Day speech to the nation Monday. He is pushing science and technology as a path to economic
development for the impoverished country, aiming for computers in every school and digitized machinery in
every factory.

However, giving citizens open access to the Internet has not been part of the regime's strategy. While some
North Koreans can access a domestic Intranet service, very few have clearance to freely surf the World Wide
Web.

It was not immediately clear who Schmidt and Richardson expect to meet in North Korea, a country that does
not have diplomatic relations with the United States. North Korea has almost no business with companies in the
U.S., which has banned the import of North Korean-made goods.

 Schmidt, however, has been a vocal advocate of providing people around the world with Internet access and
 technology.

 As Google's chief executive for a decade until 2011, Schmidt oversaw Google's ascent from a small California
 startup focused on helping computer users search the Internet to a global technology giant making inroads into
 mobile phone markets as well as mapping.

 Google now has offices in more than 40 countries, including all three of North Korea's neighbors: Russia, South
 Korea and China, another country criticized for systematic Internet censorship.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05797427 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

After being accused of complying with China's strict Internet regulations, known as "the Great Firewall of
China," Google pulled its search business from the world's largest Internet market in 2010 by redirecting traffic
from mainland China to Hong Kong. The company maintains other businesses in China, but a recent
transparency report shows Google's services there sporadically are blocked.

Since stepping aside as CEO, Schmidt has served as Google's executive chairman, largely responsible for the
company's external relationships with policymakers, business partners and governments around the world.

And in recent months, Schmidt had been working with Jared Cohen, a former U.S. State Department policy and

planning adviser who heads Google's New York-based think tank, on a book about the Internet's role in shaping
society. "The New Digital Age" is due to be published in April.

Schmidt's message: The Internet and mobile technology have the power to lift people out of poverty and
political oppression.

"The spread of mobile phones and new forms of connectivity offer us the prospect of connecting everybody," he
said in commencement speech at Boston University in May. "When that happens, connectivity can
revolutionize every aspect of society: politically, socially, economically."

The Richardson-Schmidt trip comes at a delicate time politically. In December, North Korea defiantly shot a
satellite into space on the back of a three-stage rocket last month, a launch Pyongyang has hailed as a major step

in its quest for peaceful exploration of space.

Washington and others, however, decry it as a covert test of long-range ballistic missile technology designed to
send a nuclear-tipped warhead as far as California. The UN. Security Council quickly condemned the launch,
and is deliberating whether to further punish Pyongyang for violating bans on developing its nuclear and missile
programs.

The visit also follows North Korea's announcement that an American citizen of Korean descent has been jailed
in Pyongyang on suspicion of committing "hostile" acts against the state. Conviction could draw a sentence of
10 years of hard labor under North Korea's penal code.

Kenneth Bae, identified in North Korean state media by his Korean name, Pae Jun Ho, is the fifth American

detained in North Korea in the past four years. The exact circumstances of his arrest were not clear. The Korean
Central News Agency said he was taken into custody in Rason, a special economic zone in the far north near
China and Russia, while on a tour of the area.

Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who often serves as an envoy to countries that do
not have diplomatic relations with the United States, will try to meet with North Korean officials, and possibly
Bae, to discuss the case, the sources said.

Richardson has been to North Korea at least a half-dozen times since 1994, including two trips to negotiate the
release of Americans detained by North Korea. His last visit to Pyongyang was in 2010.

Also leading the trip is Kun "Tony" Namkung, an Asian affairs expert who has made numerous visits to North
Korea over the past 25 years. Namkung also serves as a consultant to the AP.

North Korea and the U.S. fought on opposite sides of a brutal, three-year battle on the Korean Peninsula before
 signing a truce in 1953. The Korean Peninsula remains divided by a heavily fortified border, and the U.S.
 stations 28,000 troops in South Korea to protect the ally.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05797427 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

However, even before late leader Kim Jong Il's death a year ago, North Korea indicated interest in repairing
relations with Washington.

Last year, a group of North Koreans even paid a visit to Google headquarters in Mountain View, California.

         Wed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the US against a resolution calling
for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other). Even the two other states in free association with the US.

did not support the US position. Important officials in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in U.S.
assistance that Alcy Frelick has insisted on but Pres. Toribiong decided to stick with the US. The proposal to cut the small
amount of assistance that Palau is receiving is ironic in light of the substantial increase in assistance pledged to the two

other freely associated states just a few years ago. It is also misinformed and misguided.

May 22 (Reuters) - Islamic charities from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates financed a network in

U.S. ally Pakistan that recruited children as young as eight to wage holy war, a local newspaper reported on
Sunday, citing Wikileaks.

    A U.S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks said financial support estimated at $100 million a year was
making its way from those Gulf Arab states to a jihadist recruitment network in Pakistan's Punjab province,

Dawn newspaper reported.

    The November 2008 dispatch by Bryan Hunt, the then principal officer at the U.S. consulate in Lahore, was
based on discussions with local government and non-governmental sources during trips to Punjab, Pakistan's

most populous province.

    It said those sources claimed that financial aid from Saudi and United Arab Emirates was coming from
 "missionary" and "Islamic charitable" organisations ostensibly with the direct support of those countries'
 governments.

    Saudi Arabia, the United States and Pakistan heavily supported the Afghan mujahideen against Soviet
 occupation troops in the 1980s.

    Militancy subsequently mushroomed in the region and militants moved to Pakistan's northwest tribal areas

 along the border with Afghanistan, seen as a global hub for militants.

    Since then there has been a growing nexus between militant groups there and in Punjab. In recent years

 militants have been carrying out suicide bombings seemingly at will in Pakistan, despite military offensives
 against their strongholds.

Re: Egypt in Libya; US rhetoric

I am told this information is especially sensitive. Two points that can be drawn:

    1. The commitment of Egyptian Special Forces to the overthrow of Qaddafi is rooted in more than

        longstanding Egyptian hostility to Qaddafi, but also the Egyptians' belief that their economic future may
       be greatly aided by the outcome in Libya and the relationship with post-Qaddafi Libya.

    2. The personal name-calling by certain U.S. officials of Qaddafi is stiffening his resistance and he is using
        it internally to support his case with his followers that he is fighting Western/Israeli imperialism, foreign
        interests, etc., according to one of his advisers. This rhetoric differs from the formal condemnations of

        Qaddafi's abusive rule and policies by other senior officials and Western governments.

During late February, 2011 Field Marshall Hussein Tantawi, Chairman of Egypt's ruling

Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) and Army Chief of Staff Sami Annan

ordered elite, clandestine Special Operations units of the Egyptian Army to begin •

        <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05785249 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

carefully providing support to the forces fighting against Libya's Muammar
Qaddafi. Officers from these clandestine units have crossed the border into Libya and

made contact with representatives of the National Libyan Council (NLC) in Benghazi and

begun discussing how to provide support and weapons to the opposition forces. This aid

will be particularly valuable as these anti-government forces are formed into rudimentary

military units by Libyan Army officers who have gone over to the opposition. These

Egyptian troops are operating with great care, as Tantawi and the other members of the

SCAF do not want this effort to come to light in any way.

According to knowledgeable individuals. Tantawi, Annan, and the staff of the SCAF want the

opposition forces to succeed in their fight against Qaddafi, and restore stability to Libya. The

Egyptian leaders are deeply concerned about the refugee crisis along their border, and the

danger of potential terrorists taking advantage of the situation to enter Egypt.
The Egyptian military commanders harbor longstanding animosities toward Qaddafi,

particularly regarding territorial disputes over the oil rich region along Libya's Southeastern

border. The Egyptian authorities are also allowing NLC supporters to bring cash across the

border to support the activities of the anti-Qaddafi opposition forces. This program is being

managed under very tight security controls; however, one particularly sensitive source added

that a small number of these Egyptian Special Operations officers are assisting opposition

forces in their successful defense of the town of Zawiyah against repeated attacks by up to 2000

troops loyal to Qaddafi.

(Source Comment: According to knowledgeable individuals the Egyptian Special Operations
troops are working in small teams under cover as Libyans from the border region with

Egypt. Also, Tantawi, Annan, and the other leaders of Egypt want to see the Libyan oil fields

return to full capacity as soon as possible. The cash remittances sent home by the Egyptians

working in these fields are a major source of revenue for the country. These payments will be

particularly important as the SCAF, and the new government that follows, attempt to improve

Egypt's economic situation.)

According to sources in Libya, the NLC and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa

 Mohamed Abdel Galil, are working to establish an orderly system to provide food and other

         <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05785249 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

essential materials to the people of Benghazi and Eastern Libya. The NLC is proceeding

cautiously in this effort, resisting the temptation to call itself an interim government in an effort

to avoid angering the other anti-Qaddafi groups; however, they are faced with shortages that

must be addressed.

At the same time an adviser to Qaddafi states that the Libyan leader remains confident he can

survive this crisis and regain control of the country. As the revolution has continued, the circle

of people around Qaddafi has contracted to a group of family members and longtime

supporters, many of whom feel that if Qaddafi falls they will be held to account for activities

conducted on his behalf. According to this individual Qaddafi and his sons are prepared to

carry on this struggle as an all out civil war if a revolutionary government is established in

Benghazi. These individuals add that Qaddafi also believes the revolution against his
government is being funded and supported by foreign regimes, business interests, and Islamists

hostile to him and his family. This individual added that policy statements by senior officials of

the United States government continue to anger Qaddafi, who feels betrayed by Western

governments. However, Qaddafi and his sons believe that personal attacks by the United States

Ambassador to the UN, and various U.S. politicians, characterizing the Libyan leader as insane

or "delusional," serve to give credence to his claim that the revolution is being organized and

driven by foreign interests.

Re: Egypt in Libya; US rhetoric
</span>

I am told this information is especially sensitive. Two points that can be drawn:

    1.  The commitment of Egyptian Special Forces to the overthrow of Qaddafi is rooted in more than
        longstanding Egyptian hostility to Qaddafi, but also the Egyptians' belief that their economic future may
        be greatly aided by the outcome in Libya and the relationship with post-Qaddafi Libya.

    2.  The personal name-calling by certain U.S. officials of Qaddafi is stiffening his resistance and he is using
        it internally to support his case with his followers that he is fighting Western/Israeli imperialism, foreign
        interests, etc., according to one of his advisers. This rhetoric differs from the formal condemnations of

        Qaddafi's abusive rule and policies by other senior officials and Western governments.

During late February, 2011 Field Marshall Hussein Tantawi, Chairman of Egypt's ruling

Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) and Army Chief of Staff Sami Annan

          <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05785244 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

ordered elite, clandestine Special Operations units of the Egyptian Army to begin

:arefully providing support to the forces fighting against Libya's Muammar

)addafi. Officers from these clandestine units have crossed the border into Libya and

nade contact with representatives of the National Libyan Council (NLC) in Benghazi and

regun discussing how to provide support and weapons to the opposition forces. This aid

vill be particularly valuable as these anti-government forces are formed into rudimentary
nilitary units by Libyan Army officers who have gone over to the opposition. These

i'gyptian troops are operating with great care, as Tantawi and the other members of the

;CAF do not want this effort to come to light in any way.

 .ccording to knowledgeable individuals Tantawi, Annan, and the staff of the SCAF want the

pposition forces to succeed in their fight against Qaddafi, and restore stability to Libya. The
7
,gyptian leaders are deeply concerned about the refugee crisis along their border, and the
[anger of potential terrorists taking advantage of the situation to enter Egypt.

['he Egyptian military commanders harbor longstanding animosities toward Qaddafi,

)articularly regarding territorial disputes over the oil rich region along Libya's Southeastern

)order. The Egyptian authorities are also allowing NLC supporters to bring cash across the

)order to support the activities of the anti-Qaddafi opposition forces. This program is being
nanaged under very tight security controls; however, one particularly sensitive source added

hat a small number of these Egyptian Special Operations officers are assisting opposition

brces in their successful defense of the town of Zawiyah against repeated attacks by up to 2000

roops loyal to Qaddafi.

Source Comment: According to knowledgeable individuals the Egyptian Special Operations
roops are working in small teams under cover as Libyans from the border region with

'3gypt. Also, Tantawi, Annan, and the other leaders of Egypt want to see the Libyan oil fields

eturn to full capacity as soon as possible. The cash remittances sent home by the Egyptians

vorking in these fields are a major source of revenue for the country. These payments will be

)articularly important as the SCAF, and the new government that follows, attempt to improve
:3gypt's economic situation.)

          <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05785244 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

 t.ccording to sources in Libya, the NLC and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa

&amp;flamed Abdel Galil, are working to establish an orderly system to provide food and other

ssential materials to the people of Benghazi and Eastern Libya. The NLC is proceeding

;autiously in this effort, resisting the temptation to call itself an interim government in an effort

CIavoid angering the other anti-Qaddafi groups; however, they are faced with shortages that

Ernst beaddressed.

q the same time an adviser to Qaddafi states that the Libyan leader remains confident he can
urvive this crisis and regain control of the country. As the revolution has continued, the circle

,f people around Qaddafi has contracted to a group of family members and longtime

 upporters, many of whom feel that if Qaddafi falls they will be held to account for activities

:onducted on his behalf. According to this individual Qaddafi and his sons are prepared to

 any on this struggle as an all out civil war if a revolutionary government is established in
3enghazi. These individuals add that Qaddafi also believes the revolution against his

;overnment is being funded and supported by foreign regimes, business interests, and Islamists

iostile to him and his family. This individual added that policy statements by senior officials of

he United States government continue to anger Qaddafi, who feels betrayed by Western

;overnments. However, Qaddafi and his sons believe that personal attacks by the United States
ambassador to the UN, and various U.S. politicians, characterizing the Libyan leader as insane

&gt;r "delusional," serve to give credence to his claim that the revolution is being organized and

[riven by foreign interests.

Re: The deal between MB &amp; SCAF
</span>

SOURCE: Sources with access to the highest levels of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, The Supreme Council of the
Armed Forces, and Western Intelligence and security services.
         1. On the evening of June 23, 2012, senior officials attached to the Guidance committee of the Muslim
Brotherhood (MB) were called to an emergency, secret meeting with officers of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces
(SCAF). During this session the MB was informed that on the following day Egypt's Electoral Commission would
announce the victory of Mohammed Morsi, the MB/Freedom and Justice Party (MB/FJP) candidate for President of Egypt.
The SCAF officers stated that their commander, Field Marshall Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, was concerned that the MB

followers, as well as many of the secular/liberal groups were becoming increasingly volatile during the extended vote
counting period. The MB representatives, after a call to Supreme Guide Mohammed Badie, assured the SCAF that there
would be no violence before the election results were announced. The SCAF officers reiterated their previous position
that Tantawi and the SCAF do not want to rule the country, but they will not tolerate any move that limits either their
budget, or their position of respect in society. The MB officials, who were extremely happy with the news they had just
received, assured their SCAF interlocutors that Badie, Morsi, and the rest of the MB leadership were committed to this

position.

         2. According to a very sensitive source, the MB officials added that Morsi would chose government officials from
a wide spectrum of parties and movements, ranging from the Salafist al Nour party to secular/liberal groups like the April 6

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773985 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

Movement. The SCAF officers had no problem with this, but added that the current military decrees would remain in
place, at least until the constitution is drafted and a new parliament is elected. In the opinion of this individual, the MB
representatives were under instructions from Badie to avoid getting into an argument on this point, at this particular time.
Having won the presidency, Badie and his advisors believe that public opinion, and political momentum will allow the MB
to dominate the entire government. In this regard he also believes it is important that the MB not overreach, as Morsi, and

the FJP speaker of Parliament, Saad Al-Katany had done in the weeks leading up to the second round of voting.

         3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Badie believes that the aggressive tactics of the MB/FJP
supporters, in the period immediately before the second round of voting, led to Tantawi moving to dissolve parliament,
and redefine the duties of the president. The Supreme Guide wants Morsi to realize that if they maintain their studied
pace, they will get everything they want. The MB polling noted that despite the fact that Morsi's opponent Ahmed Shafik

is a former commanding general of the Air Force, approximately seventy (70) per cent of the regular army troops
supported the MB candidate. At the same time, as many as forty (40) per cent of the members of the April 6 movement
also voted for Morsi. The MB leadership also intends to include Coptic Christians and some women in the new
government, in an effort to the new Egypt as an inclusive, moderate Islamic State. Their challenge is to find individuals
who they feel they can trust, and who are willing to serve under Morsi. According to this individual, the Coptic community

in particular is frustrated over what it sees as voter fraud and intimidation of its members by the FJP in Christian areas.)

         4. At the end of this meeting, according to this source, the MB and SCAF representatives agreed to stay in
contact and to do what is necessary to prevent any violence, while recognizing the important role the military will continue
to play in Egyptian society. Both sides recognize that there will be incidents resulting from the political passions at play in
the country, and agree that they must prevent these incidents from getting out of hand. The SCAF officers also agreed
that they would not overreact to statements from MB supporters regarding a reduced role forthe military in government.

The SCAF officers added that Tantawi was not unhappy with the result of the election, as he and Shafik have a poor
personal relationship, and a history of competition for power within the military under the regime of the former President
Hosni Mubarak.

         5. (Source Comment: According to this individual, both sides agreed that their first order of business together in
the new Egyptian political situation will be developing a coherent policy toward Israel. The SCAF officers pointed out that

Israel is extremely concerned about the changes in Egypt. The MB officials added that they would like to maintain and
enhance the policy the SCAF and MB developed during the 2011 uprising: maintaining the Peace Treaty with Israel, while
limiting joint activity and cooperation on sensitive security matters. Both sides also agreed that, after the election, it will be
important to create a positive working environment for foreign firms, particularly those from the United States and Western
Europe. The MB officials stated that Badie and Morsi are firmly committed to a dual Islamic/Western banking system and
good relations with Western firms. He regularly states that the West has dealt with Saudi Arabia for many years and the

system he anticipates for Egypt will be far less restrictive than the one put in place by the Saudi rulers. Badie also
believes the fact that Morsi was educated in the United States and has many good contacts in that country.)

         6. The representatives of the MB and the SCAF will meet again during the week of June 25, and will continue
regular contact as they prepare for the drafting of the new Constitution and parliamentary elections. Both sides agreed
that they must also keep a careful eye on the situation in Syria, which could spread to Lebanon and other countries,

potentially creating a situation affecting Egypt's security.

Re: Syria, Turkey, Israel, Iran
</span>

SOURCE: Sources with access to the highest levels of the Governments and institutions discussed below. This includes
political parties and regional intelligence and security services.

        1. According to an individual with access to the highest levels of major European governments, the

intelligence services of these countries are reporting to their principals that the commanders of the Israeli

military and intelligence community believe that the civil war in Syria is spreading to neighboring countries,

including Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey . These European officials are concerned that the ongoing conflict in

Syria will lead to uprisings in these countries that will bring increasingly conservative Islamic regimes into

power, replacing existing secular or moderate regimes. This individual adds that, Israeli security officials

believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that these developments will leave them

vulnerable, with only enemies on their borders.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05795332 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

        2. In private conversations senior Israeli Intelligence and Military commaders state to their European

associates that they have long viewed the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad, while hostile, as a known

quantity and a buffer between Israel and the more militant Muslim countries, a situation that is threatened by the

growing successs of the rebel forces of the Free Syria Army (FSA). This source is convinced that these Israeli

leaders are now drawing up contingency plans to deal with a regional structure where the new revolutionary
regimes that take over the various countries will be controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood and possibly more

problematic groups such as al Qa'ida, which doesn't bode well for the Israelis.

        3. At the same time, looking at the tensions between Israel and Iran as part of the overall situation in the

region, these European heads of state are receiving reporting indicating that if Israel were to attack the Iranian
nuclear facilities at this time it would only exacerbate relations with their neighbors. In addition, such an attack

may lead to further deterioration in the world economy, which would in turn be blamed on Israel. These sources

believe that such an attack would also unite the Iranian population against the United States and strengthen their

ties to the Mullahs, rather than weaken them. These particular individuals fear that this in turn would accelerate
Iranian efforts at building a nuclear arsenal, seeking additional support from their contacts in Russia and China.

        4. According to a source with direct access, Turkish Army commanders have stated in private

discussions with the highest levels of their Government that an Israeli attack on Iran will surely start a regional
war "before the first Israel air-strike sortie has returned to base". Turkish intelligence estimates, supported by

their liaison contacts in Western European intelligence services, advise that thousands of missiles and rockets

would fall on Israel fired from Iran, Lebanon, Syria, and Gaza.

        5.
           (Source Comment: The Turkish Army estimates that Syria and Lebanon Hezbollah forces have
access to over 200,000 surface to surface rockets and missiles. Their military analysts also believe that an

assault from such a force would overwhelm Israel's defenses.)

        6.
           According to these individuals, the European intelligence sources are also advising their heads of
state that international economic sanctions are truly hurting the Iranian economy and have begun to foster

frustration among the Iranian people. Sources in Tehran report that this hostility is increasingly aimed at the

ruling party. These indivdivals also advise that an Israeli attack against Iran would immediately serve to

undermine this situation, turning the populaton against Israel, the United States, and Western Europe in support
of their rulers, both Islamic and Secular. In this regard, these European security leaders regularly site the words

of Prime Minister Netanyahu: "Iran in particular is susceptible to economic pressure. The oil-exporting Islamic

republic is virtually a single-crop economy, and imposition of a tight blockade against Iranian oil sales will

undoubtedly induce in Teheran a prompt revaluation of the utility of even indirect terrorist tactics."

        <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05795332 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

            7. One particular source states that the British and French Intelligence services believe that their Israeli

    counterparts are convinced that there is a positive side to the civil war in Syria; if the Assad regime topples, Iran

    would lose its only ally in the Middle East and would be isolated. At the same time, the fall of the House of

    Assad could well ignite a sectarian war between the Shiites and the majority Sunnis of the region drawing in
    Iran, which, in the view of Israeli commaders would not be a bad thing for Israel and its Western allies. In the

    opinion of this individual, such a scenario would distract and might obstruct Iran from its nuclear activities for a

    good deal of time. In addition, certain senior Israeli intelligence analysts believe that this turn of events may

    even prove to be a factor in the eventual fall of the current government of Iran.

            8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this particularly sensitive source, after discussions with Israeli

    contacts, if you consider Israel's position at this juncture, with all that is ongoing in the region, what position

    would you take? At present, considering that Israel is not prepared for an all out war with Iran, they may   well

    continue to threaten action, giving the impression they are serious about pursuing aggresive Iranian anti-nuclear
    efforts. One way to do that is to update weapon systems; secure an air base in Saudi Arabia that would suggest a

    staging ground for an eventual attack, then "leak" the word to the media that their are eminent plans to carry out

    a bombing raid and do everything possible to persuade the world they mean business.)

            9. At the same time, a separate sensitive source added that the European security services are concerned

    that this brinksmanship could lead to missteps that could, in turn, lead to a regional war. In this regard these

    European services are staying in close contact with their Israeli counterparts as they attempt to manipulate

    events while avoiding a general conflict at this time. This individual stated that a senior Israeli military
    commander described the current situation from the Israeli perspective by quoting Sun Tzu wrote in THE ART

    OF WAR: "He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight."

problematic groups such as al Qa'ida, which doesn't bode well for the Israelis.

        3. At the same time, looking at the tensions between Israel and Iran as part of the overall situation in the
region, these European heads of state are receiving reporting indicating that if Israel were to attack the Iranian

nuclear facilities at this time it would only exacerbate relations with their neighbors. In addition, such an attack

may lead to further deterioration in the world economy, which would in turn be blamed on Israel. These sources

believe that such an attack would also unite the Iranian population against the United States and strengthen their

ties to the Mullahs, rather than weaken them. These particular individuals fear that this in turn would accelerate
Iranian efforts at building a nuclear arsenal, seeking additional support from their contacts in Russia and China.

        4. According to a source with direct access, Turkish Army commanders have stated in private

discussions with the highest levels of their Government that an Israeli attack on Iran will surely start a regional
war "before the first Israel air-strike sortie has returned to base". Turkish intelligence estimates, supported by

their liaison contacts in Western European intelligence services, advise that thousands of missiles and rockets

would fall on Israel fired from Iran, Lebanon, Syria, and Gaza.

        5. (Source Comment: The Turkish Army estimates that Syria and Lebanon Hezbollah forces have

access to over 200,000 surface to surface rockets and missiles. Their military analysts also believe that an

assault from such a force would overwhelm Israel's defenses.)

        6. According to these individuals, the European intelligence sources are also advising their heads of

state that international economic sanctions are truly hurting the Iranian economy and have begun to foster

frustration among the Iranian people. Sources in Tehran report that this hostility is increasingly aimed at the

ruling party. These indivdivals also advise that an Israeli attack against Iran would immediately serve to
undermine this situation, turning the populaton against Israel, the United States, and Western Europe in support

of their rulers, both Islamic and Secular. In this regard, these European security leaders regularly site the words

of Prime Minister Netanyahu: "Iran in particular is susceptible to economic pressure. The oil-exporting Islamic

republic is virtually a single-crop economy, and imposition of a tight blockade against Iranian oil sales will

undoubtedly induce in Teheran a prompt revaluation of the utility of even indirect terrorist tactics."

         <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05795336 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

            7. One particular source states that the British and French Intelligence services believe that their Israeli

    counterparts are convinced that there is a positive side to the civil war in Syria; if the Assad regime topples, Iran

    would lose its only ally in the Middle East and would be isolated. At the same time, the fall of the House of

    Assad could well ignite a sectarian war between the Shiites and the majority Sunnis of the region drawing in
    Iran, which, in the view of Israeli commaders would not be a bad thing for Israel and its Western allies. In the

    opinion of this individual, such a scenario would distract and might obstruct Iran from its nuclear activities for a

    good deal of time. In addition, certain senior Israeli intelligence analysts believe that this turn of events may

    even prove to be a factor in the eventual fall of the current government of Iran.

            8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this particularly sensitive source, after discussions with Israeli

    contacts, if you consider Israel's position at this juncture, with all that is ongoing in the region, what position

    would you take? At present, considering that Israel is not prepared for an all out war with Iran, they may well

    continue to threaten action, giving the impression they are serious about pursuing aggresive Iranian anti-nuclear
    efforts. One way to do that is to update weapon systems; secure an air base in Saudi Arabia that would suggest a

    staging ground for an eventual attack, then "leak" the word to the media that their are eminent plans to carry out

    a bombing raid and do everything possible to persuade the world they mean business.)

            9. At the same time, a separate sensitive source added that the European security services are concerned

    that this brinksmanship could lead to missteps that could, in turn, lead to a regional war. In this regard these

    European services are staying in close contact with their Israeli counterparts as they attempt to manipulate

    events while avoiding a general conflict at this time. This individual stated that a senior Israeli military
    commander described the current situation from the Israeli perspective by quoting Sun Tzu wrote in THE ART

    OF WAR: "He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight."

  Re: The deal between MB &amp; SCAF
</span>

  SOURCE: Sources with access to the highest levels of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, The
  Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, and Western Intelligence and security services.

         1. On the evening of June 23, 2012, senior officials attached to the Guidance committee

  of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB)   were  called to an emergency, secret meeting with officers of
  the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF). During this session the MB was informed
  that on the following day Egypt's Electoral Commission would announce the victory of

  Mohammed Morsi, the MB/Freedom and Justice Party (MB/FJP) candidate for President of
  Egypt. The SCAF officers stated that their commander, Field Marshall Mohammed Hussein

  Tantawi, was concerned that the MB followers, as well as many of the secular/liberal groups
  were becoming increasingly volatile during the extended vote counting period. The MB
  representatives, after a call to Supreme Guide Mohammed Badie, assured the SCAF that there

  would be no violence before the election results were announced. The SCAF officers reiterated
  their previous position that Tantawi and the SCAF do not want to rule the country, but they will
  not tolerate any move that limits either their budget, or their position of respect in society. The

  MB officials, who were extremely happy with the news they had just received, assured their
  SCAF interlocutors that Badie, Morsi, and the rest of the MB leadership were committed to this
  position.

         2. According to a very sensitive source, the MB officials added that Morsi would chose
  government officials from a wide spectrum of parties and movements, ranging from the Salafist
  al Nour party to secular/liberal groups like the April 6 Movement. The SCAF officers had no

  problem with this, but added that the current military decrees would remain in place, at least until
  the constitution is drafted and a new parliament is elected. In the opinion of this individual, the

  MB representatives were under instructions from Badie to avoid getting into an argument on this

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05794868 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

  point, at this particular time. Having won the presidency, Badie and his advisors believe that
  public opinion, and political momentum will allow the MB to dominate the entire government.
  In this regard he also believes it is important that the MB not overreach, as Morsi, and the FJP

  speaker of Parliament, Saad Al-Katany had done in the weeks leading up to the second round of
  voting.

          3.
            (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Badie believes that the aggressive
  tactics of the MB/FJP supporters, in the period immediately before the second round of voting,
  led to Tantawi moving to dissolve parliament, and redefine the duties of the president. The

  Supreme Guide wants Morsi to realize that if they maintain their studied pace, they will get
  everything they want. The MB polling noted that despite the fact that Morsi's opponent Ahmed
  Shafik is a former commanding general of the Air Force, approximately seventy (70) per cent of

  the regular army troops supported the MB candidate. At the same time, as many as forty (40) per
  cent of the members of the April 6 movement also voted for Morsi. The MB leadership also
  intends to include Coptic Christians and some women in the new government, in an effort to the

  new Egypt as an inclusive, moderate Islamic State. Their challenge is to find individuals who
  they feel they can trust, and who are willing to serve under Morsi. According to this individual,
  the Coptic community in particular is frustrated over what it sees as voter fraud and intimidation

  of its members by the FJP in Christian areas.)

          4. At the end of this meeting, according to this source, the MB and SCAF representatives

  agreed to stay in contact and to do what is necessary to prevent any violence, while recognizing
  the important role the military will continue to play in Egyptian society. Both sides recognize
  that there will be incidents resulting from the political passions at play in the country, and agree

  that they must prevent these incidents from getting out of hand. The SCAF officers also agreed
  that they would not overreact to statements from MB supporters regarding a reduced role for the
  military in government. The SCAF officers added that Tantawi was not unhappy with the result

  of the election, as he and Shafik have a poor personal relationship, and a history of competition
  for power within the military under the regime of the former President Hosni Mubarak.

          5. (Source Comment: According to this individual, both sides agreed that their first

  order of business together in the new Egyptian political situation will be developing a coherent
  policy toward Israel. The SCAF officers pointed out that Israel is extremely concerned about the
  changes in Egypt. The MB officials added that they would like to maintain and enhance the

  policy the SCAF and MB developed during the 2011 uprising: maintaining the Peace Treaty with
  Israel, while limiting joint activity and cooperation on sensitive security matters. Both sides also

  agreed that, after the election, it will be important to create a positive working environment for

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05794868 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

  foreign firms, particularly those from the United States and Western Europe. The MB officials
  stated that Badie and Morsi are firmly committed to a dual Islamic/Western banking system and

  good relations with Western firms. He regularly states that the West has dealt with Saudi Arabia
  for many years and the system he anticipates for Egypt will be far less restrictive than the one put
  in place by the Saudi rulers. Badie also believes the fact that Morsi was educated in the United

  States and has many good contacts in that country.)

          6. The representatives of the MB and the SCAF will meet again during the week of June

  25, and will continue regular contact as they prepare for the drafting of the new Constitution and
  parliamentary elections. Both sides agreed that they must also keep a careful eye on the situation

  in Syria, which could spread to Lebanon and other countries, potentially creating a situation
  affecting Egypt's security.

BEIJING, Oct 25 (Reuters) - China on Tuesday pressed Syria to heed the "reasonable" demands of its people
and live up to promises of reform, ahead of a visit to Damascus by Beijing's special envoy to. the Middle East.

   China has played a low-key role in the turmoil that has swept the Middle East and North Africa, but it has
also moved swiftly to normalise ties with governments which have been overthrown by popular revolts, such as
in Libya.

   "We hope that all sides in Syria can put the interests of the country and people first, discard violence, avoid
bloodshed and clashes, and resolve differences via dialogue in a peaceful way," said Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Jiang Yu.

   "We believe that Syria's government should proactively fulfill its promises of reform, and answer the
people's reasonable demands," she told a regular news briefing.

   Chinese envoy Wu Sike would visit Syria, along with Egypt, from Oct. 26-30, Jiang added, without
providing details.

   China, along with Russia, recently resisted a Western push for a United Nations Security Council resolution
condemning the Syrian government's crackdown on pro-reform protests that began over half a year ago.

   The United States said on Monday it had pulled its ambassador out of Syria because of threats to his safety,
prompting Syria to follow suit in a deterioration of ties already battered over President Bashar al-Assad's
crackdown against protesters.

    The United States has called for Assad to step down and, along with European allies, has intensified
sanctions on Syria, including against its small but significant oil sector, a central source of foreign currency for
the government.

The Secretary's Phone Calls with Japanese, ROK, Chinese and Russian Foreign Ministers

 Monday, May 25, 2009

 Purpose: To reach out to Japan, South Korea, China and Russia following the probable May 24 DPRK nuclear test.

 •     A nuclear test by North Korea, if confirmed, would be a provocative act and an unequivocal violation of UNSCR

 1718, blatantly disregarding the will of the international community.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758592 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

•    We have remained united in the face of the DPRK's provocations, and we need to maintain this unity among the

Six-Party partners. The DPRK's message to us in advance of the test, which blamed the UNSC's "failure to apologize for
its Presidential Statement," demonstrates the degree to which the DPRK has isolated itself. Now is the right time for a

•    It is essential that the UN Security Council take strong measures to clearly demonstrate that the DPRK's actions will

have consequences. The United States believes that it is essential that the Security Council issue a swift statement
condemning the DPRK's test at its initial May 25 emergency meeting. The UNSC should then quickly follow up with a

strong new Chapter 7 Resolution that includes concrete response measures.

Dear Cheryl:

   You might have received a copy of this e-mail last night or this morning. If so, please disregard this e-mail
and my apologies for the confusion. It appears, however, that Georgetown's e-mail system had a problem and

the earlier e-mail was most likely lost. So, trying again 	   My best, Barry

TO: Cheryl D. Mills
      Counselor of the Department and Chief of Staff

      U.S. Department of State

Dear Cheryl:

   First, I want to applaud tardily Secretary Clinton's efforts to convince the U.S. Government and the United
Nations to decide to intervene for very good reasons in Libya last March. As you probably well know, U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1973 was the first U.N. approval for humanitarian intervention against the will of a

country with major military forces because of that country's treatment of its own citizens. The United States
and its NATO allies were unable to obtain such a U.N. resolution in the Kosovo situation in 1999, though NATO
went ahead with the bombing campaign.

   Second, I also applaud Secretary Clinton's initiative, announced last Thursday, to ask Congress to pass a
law to allow some of the approximately $34 billion in frozen Libyan funds to be used to support the Libyan

rebels.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05786849 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

   I wanted, however, to raise with you a warning flag. The budget hawks in Congrese and elsewhere' might
well also push to divert some of the frozen assets to pay for the U.S. militarY activities in and around Libya-

e.g., the bombs, fuel for our planes and ships, and related cotts—or even that some of the funds be used
generally to reduce the U.S. deficit.

   I attended an off-the-record meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations about three weeks ago where,

among others, some smart lawyers and former political appointees from the Bush Administration discussed the
possibility of using the Libyan funds to help pay the U.S. military costs of its role in Libya. This last week I
heard a conservative lawyer propose that some the funds be used for deficit reduction. I do not know whether
the idea of diverting some of the frozen funds has reached budget hawks like Rep. Paul Ryan or Tea Party'ers,
but I expect it will soon arise in the course of the debate over this Administration's proposal to help the rebels.

   A related point. It is understandable that the Administration wants to involve Congress in the decision to
provide funds to the Libyan rebels. I believe, however, that here is a strong legal case that new Congressional
approval is not needed for the. President if he wants to take title to some or all of the $34 billion and use it
however he directs. David Aufhauser, the former General Counsel in Treasury under President George W.

Bush, supports that view (and agreed that I might use his name). Indeed, David was a key participant in
Bush's unfreezing and taking title to over $1 billion in Iraqi assets after our 2003 invasion of Iraq, and then
sending the funds back to the Development Fund for Iraq. Bush took the action pursuant to a 2001
amendment to the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. § 1702 (a)(1)(C). It
provides that the President may take title to the frozen assets and decide how they are used, sold, etc., "when
the United States is engaged in armed hostilities" with a,country.

   On a personal note. I believe that diverting the funds to reduce our deficit or to pay the U.S military's
expenses would be inconsistent with President Obama's statements, such as "[T]he money doesn't belong to
Qaddafi or to us—it belongs to the Libyan people." It would be inconsistent with U.N. Security Council
Resolutions 1970 and 1973. And it would lead many Libyans and many of our allies to question our

intentions. The crudest charge might be that we would be wrongfully using Muslim money to fund a war
against Muslims.

   Hope this is helpful.

                           My best, Barry

P.S. I have also brought this possible support for unwanted diversions of the frozen Libyan assets to the

attention of U/S Bob Hormats, as well as Tom Delare in EEB and David Mortlock in L. I regularly work with
Tom and David in my role as chair of the Sanctions Subcommittee of the State Department's Advisory
Committee on International Economic Policy (ACIEP). (Tom and David have been outstanding in their
cooperation with the Subcommittee.) However, given the likely fast pace of events after Secretary Clinton's
announcement last Thursday, I thought it might be helpful to pass this information on to you directly.

        Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton

         Secretary of State of the United States
         Washington, DC

        Dear Secretary Clinton:

        During the course of the Fifteenth Anniversary joint Review of the Compact of Free Association

        between the United States and Palau, I had to convey disappointment at times with positions
        taken by some Department of State personnel. I am writing today, however, to compliment the
         letter that Acting Assistant Secretary Rodriguez sent Chairman Bingaman of the U.S. Senate
        Committee on Energy and Natural Resources April 5   thregarding the Senate bill to implement the
        Agreement produced by the Review and also to compliment the efforts that Deputy Assistant
        Secretary Reed has made regarding the Agreement.

        The letter and efforts have displayed deep understanding of the relationship between our freely
        associated states and the mutual benefits flowing from this special association as well as what is
        needed to approve the Agreement and continue the association.

        Let me  also take this opportunity to express great appreciation for the instrumental actions that
        you and members of your staff took to resolve Review issues, for work done by then Deputy
        Secretary Lew, and for the involvement of Assistant Secretary Campbell. This attention was
        absolutely critical to obtaining agreement. I took very seriously the advice given through Jeff

        Farrow last summer that the Review should be concluded so that an agreement could be approved
        last year and am grateful for the opportunity that we then had to finally negotiate the issues as
        well as for Secretary Reed being the negotiator.

        Although the Agreement ultimately was sent to the U.S. Congress this year, I am confident that
        continued perceptive efforts, such as those by Secretaries Reed and Rodriguez, will result in a

        continuation of the free association between our nations.

        Sincerely yours,

           hnson Toribiong
         President
         Republic of Palau

  NOTE FOR THE SECRETARY

  FROM:	       L—HaroldHongjuKoh

  RE:	         Supreme Court Decision in Jerusalem Passport Case      (Zivotofsky v.
               Clinton)

         Yesterday, the Supreme Court issued its judgment in    Zivotofsky v. Clinton,

  the case about whether an American citizen born in Jerusalem is entitled to have
  his passport identify his place of birth as "Israel." The Court held that this dispute
  is not a "political question" and therefore that it can be decided by the judiciary.
  The Court did not decide, however, the substantive issue in the case: whether the
  Department must print "Israel" in Jerusalem-born citizens' passports. This issue
  will now return to the lower courts for resolution.

        The Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual states that U.S. citizens

  born in Jerusalem may not have "Israel" listed in their passports as their place of
  birth. This reflects a longstanding U.S. Government policy of recognizing no state
  as having sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem. In 2002, Congress passed and
  the President signed the FY 2003.Foreign Relations Authorization Act, which
  included a section entitled "United States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as the

  Capital of Israel." One provision in this section purports to require the Secretary of
  State to allow U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem to have their passports indicate their
  place of birth as Israel. The Department has not implemented this section of the
  law, on the ground that it intrudes on the President's constitutional authority over
  the recognition of other countries and the territories over which they have
  sovereignty. Menachem Zivotofsky, through his parents, brought suit to compel

  the Department to identify "Israel" as his place of birth on his passport, but the
  D.C. Circuit ruled that the case was a "political question" beyond the authority of a
  court to resolve.

         The Supreme Court, in a decision by Chief Justice Roberts, reversed the
  D.C. Circuit and held —contrary to the position advanced by DOJ —that the case
  does not present a political question. The Court viewed the issue as a basic
  constitutional question: does the statute interfere with the President's power to

  recognize foreign nations, or is it within Congress's power to regulate passports in
  this manner? The Court did not decide this merits question, but instead concluded
  that it is the sort of question the judiciary is competent to answer. Justices Alito

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05789936 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

  and Sotomayor concurred in separate opinions. Only Justice Breyer dissented and

  would have dismissed Zivitofsky's lawsuit as presenting a "political question."

         Although the Court's decision leaves the substantive issue for judicial
  decision, it does not call into question theU.S. Government's policy on the status
  of Jerusalem, nor does it require the Department to begin honoring requests to print
  "Israel" in the passports of Jerusalem-born citizens. The Court's decision does,

  however, mean that this litigation will continue, perhaps for many more months.
  The case now returns to the lower courts, which will decide whether the
  Department must comply with the law as written, or whether -- as we will likely
  argue—that the statute interferes with the President's authority (in which case it is
  invalid and the Department can continue disregarding Congress's instruction).

Below are the key elements of a statement which we would like to see the President send to the upcoming conference on
Ocean Law Policy May 20-21 The Law of the Sea Treaty ratification has been a serious .

policy interest of this administration. I realize there are other priorities but the the draft takes that into account. Anything
that the Secretary might be able to do to get this statement issued by the President and sent to the Conference would be
much appreciated. If that looks like too much heavy lifting and I know that is a rare commodity to be used judiciously,
anything she might send herself along these lines would convey a clear and valuable signal and be most appreciated at
home and abroad.(I have attached a conference agenda for your information). Tom Pickering

"I congratulate the Commission on Ocean Law Policy in your meeting to review the record and support the

ratification by the United States of the Law of the Sea Treaty. I am pleased to join with every American
President since the treaty was first submitted to the Senate in 1994, whether Democratic or Republican, all of

whom have supported United States' adherence since the Convention. It is an important goal of this
administration to secure Senate advice and c- onsent to the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea [this year]

[as soon as possible]. The convention has the support of every living Chief of Naval Operations and

Commandant of the US Coast Guard, the endorsement of every living former Secretary of State since the
Reagan Administration, the leading business organizations and industry associations and hundreds of other
security experts, practitioners and scholars. By adopting this Convention, America will join 159 other nations
plus the European Union in supporting the rule of law in the world's oceans. The Convention strengthens our

security, secures our sovereignty and promotes the sustainable development of our ocean resources Adoption
will facilitate access to offshore resources, enhance naval and air mobility, strengthen homeland security, and
restore United States leadership in ocean affairs."

Dear Cheryl:

   You might have received a copy of this e-mail last night or this morning. If so, please disregard this e-mail
and my apologies for the confusion. It appears, however, that Georgetown's e-mail system had a problem and

the earlier e-mail was most likely lost. So, trying again	   My best, Barry

TO: Cheryl D. Mills
      Counselor of the Department and Chief of Staff
      U.S. Department of State

Dear Cheryl:

   First, I want to applaud tardily Secretary Clinton's efforts to convince the U.S. Government and the United

Nations to decide to intervene for very good reasons in Libya last March. As you probably well know, U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1973 was the first U.N. approval for humanitarian intervention against the will of a
country with major military forces because of that country's treatment of its own citizens. The United States

and its NATO allies were unable to obtain such a U.N. resolution in the Kosovo situation in 1999, though NATO
went ahead with the bombing campaign.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05785353 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

   Second, I also applaud Secretary Clinton's initiative, announced last Thursday, to ask Congress to pass a
lawto allowsome of the approximately $34 billion in frozen Libyan funds to be used to support the Libyan
rebels.

   I wanted, however, to raise with you a warning flag. The budget hawks in Congress and elsewhere might

well also push to divert some of the frozen assets to pay for the U.S. military activities in and around Libya-
e.g., the bombs, fuel for our planes and ships, and related costs—or even that some of the funds be used
generally to reduce the U.S. deficit.

   I attended an off-the-record meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations about three weeks ago where,

among others, some smart lawyers and former political appointees fromthe Bush Administration discussed the
possibility of using the Libyan funds to help pay the U.S. military costs of its role in Libya. This last week I
heard a conservative lawyer propose that some the funds be used for deficit reduction. I do not know whether
the idea of diverting some of the frozen funds has reached budget hawks like Rep. Paul Ryan or Tea Party'ers,
but I expect it will soon arise in the course of the debate over this Administration's proposal to help the rebels.

   A related point. It is understandable that the Administration wants to involve Congress in the decision to
provide funds to the Libyan rebels. I believe, however, that here is a strong, legal case that new Congressional
approval is not needed for the President if he wants to take title to some or all of the $34 billion and use it
however he directs. David Aufhauser, the former General Counsel in Treasury under President George W.

Bush, supports that view (and agreed that I might use his name). Indeed, David was a key participant in
Bush's unfreezing and taking title to over $1 billion in Iraqi assets after our 2003 invasion of Iraq, and then
sending the funds back to the Development Fund for Iraq. Bush took the action pursuant to a 2001
amendment to the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. § 1702 (a)(1)(C). It
provides that the President may take title to the frozen assets and decide how they are used, sold, etc., "when

the United States is engaged in armed hostilities" with a country.

   On a personal note. I believe that diverting the funds to reduce our deficit or to pay'he U.S. military's
expenses would be inconsistent with President Obama's statements, such as: "[T]he money doesn't belong to
Qaddafi or to us—it beldngs to the Libyan people." It would be inconsistent with U.N. Security Council
Resolutions 1970 and 1973. And it would lead many Libyans and many of our allies to question our

intentions. The crudest charge might be that we would be wrongfully using Muslimmoney to fund a war
against Muslims.

   Hope this is helpful.

                           My best, Barry

P.S. I have also brought this possible support for unwanted diversions of the frozen Libyan assets to the

attention of U/S Bob Hormats, as well as Tom Delare in EEB and David Mortlock in L. I regularly work with
Tomand David in my role as chair of the Sanctions Subcommittee of the State Department's Advisory
Committee on International Economic Policy (ACIEP). (Tom and David have been outstanding in their
cooperation with the Subcommittee.) However, given the likely fast pace of events after Secretary Clinton's
announcement last Thursday, I thought it might be helpful topass this informationontoyoudirectly.

This is what we're proposing to put out in your name. We've crafted the statement in a way that doesn't pronounce

definitively on what happened but is strong and tough. Can you take a look? (Sorry for the caps)

The United States condemns

in the strongest possible terms yesterday's massacre in the Syrian village of Haoula. United Nations observers have
confirmed that dozens of men, women, and children were killed and hundreds more wounded in a vicious assault that

involved a REGIME artillery and tank barrage on a residential neighborhood.

The world will spare no effort to IDENTIFY AND HOLD accountABLE THOSE who perpetrated this atrocity. And the
UNITED STATES will WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO intensify our pressure on Asad and his cronies,

whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end.

WE stand in solidarity with the Syrian people and the peaceful marchers in cities across Syria who have taken to the
streets to denounce the massacre in Haoula.

This is an international organization position, for which the USG nominates a candidate to the international organization

 itself.

 We can put up anyone — career or non-career

 There is no guarantee that US candidate will be accepted

 And individual and USG have to lobby the organization to get our candidate accepted

 1.  (SBU) Summary: The United States must quickly identify a successor for OECD Deputy
 Secretary General Richard Boucher who says he will leave Paris in 2013. The ideal candidate

 is a francophone political economist of at least ambassadorial rank with experience in Europe

 plus Latin America and/or Asia. Diversity is key; we strongly recommend identifying a
 qualified female candidate. Currently, the Secretary General and all four Deputy Secretaries

 General are men. End summary.

    '(SBU) Deputy Secretary General (DSG) Richard Boucher informed mission officers that he
 2.
 intends to leave his position in 2013. The USG should identify strong, qualified, dynamic U.S.

 citizen candidates to fill this position. Traditionally an American holds one of the four DSG

 jobs. Former U.S. ambassadors such as Richard Hecklinger and Boucher have performed
 well. Secretary General Gurria, who will have enormous sway in any final choice, would

 expect an American of a certain caliber to take over. We understand he would prefer someone

 more "political" in nature -- i.e., closely connected to the President. Currently one DSG is a
 former Belgian Prime Minister; another is a former Japanese Deputy Finance Minister. Gurria

 previously served as Mexico's Foreign and Finance Minister.

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793211 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

3. (SBU) USOECD believes the ideal candidate combines strong political economic and

economic policy background with proven diplomatic skills. Multilateral experience would be
helpful, but not crucial. He or she should appeal to big and small European, Latin American,
and North East Asian governments. G7 imprimatur is necessary, APEC OECD member (New

Zealand, Australia, Japan, Chile, Mexico, Korea, and Canada) support would be
useful. French skills are a big plus. In light of the OECD's new outward orientation,

development or developing country experience and entrée with Chinese, Indian, and Brazilian
interlocutors would also be advantageous. To the extent possible, the USG should seek diverse
candidates, particularly women, to fill the position.

4. (SBU) The United States must act quickly to identify and advocate for a single nominee or
a very short list of preferred candidates. USOECD and Washington officials should begin
selling that choice to key Member states and preparing the ground with the Secretary General

early in 2013. Gurria, in his inimitable style, would certainly fill any vacuum by choosing and
lobbying strongly for his hand-picked American DSG (whoever that might be). A cautionary

tale: mission officers were told that DSG Rintaro Tamaki, who arrived in 2011, was not the
Government of Japan's choice. Rather, the Secretary General presented Tamaki to members as
a fait accompli. Tamaki is a capable, thoughtful, and intelligent man, but defers to Gurria. He

has been a "low-impact" DSG, especially on important development-related issues. Belgian
Yves Leterme has also failed to make his mark in his first year. Pier Carlo Padoan — the Italian
DSG who is also the OECD's Chief Economist and leads the Economic Directorate — was

sidelined in the important "New Challenges to Economic Challenges" discussions despite

proactive as he pursues engagement with emerging economic powers and enlargement -
exactly what the OECD needs to remain modern and relevant (per QDDR instructions

5.  (SBU) Comment: Mission urges serious State and interagency action to identify best
candidates to replace Boucher so that we will be in the driver's seat on this selection. As the

challenging and offers the potential to deeply enhance the organization's global

 There is no guarantee that US candidate will be accepted

</span>

 1.  (SBU) Summary: The United States must quickly identify a successor for OECD Deputy
 Secretary General Richard Boucher who says he will leave Paris in 2013. The ideal candidate

 is a francophone political economist of at least ambassadorial rank with experience in Europe

 plus Latin America and/or Asia. Diversity is key; we strongly recommend identifying a
 qualified female candidate. Currently, the Secretary General and all four Deputy Secretaries

 General are men. End summary.

 2.  (SBU) Deputy Secretary General (DSG) Richard Boucher informed mission officers that he
 intends to leave his position in 2013. The USG should identify strong, qualified, dynamic U.S.

 citizen candidates to fill this position. Traditionally an American holds one of the four DSG

 jobs. Former U.S. ambassadors such as Richard Hecklinger and Boucher have performed
 well. Secretary General Gurria, who will have enormous sway in any final choice, would

 expect an American of a certain caliber to take over. We understand he would prefer someone

 more "political" in nature -- i.e., closely connected to the President. Currently one DSG is a

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793210 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

former Belgian Prime Minister; another is a former Japanese Deputy Finance Minister. Gurria
previously served as Mexico's Foreign and Finance Minister.

3. (SBU) USOECD believes the ideal candidate combines strong political economic and

economic policy background with proven diplomatic skills. Multilateral experience would be
helpful, but not crucial. He or she should appeal to big and small European, Latin American,
and North East Asian governments. G7 imprimatur is necessary, APEC OECD member (New

Zealand, Australia, Japan, Chile, Mexico, Korea, and Canada) support would be
useful. French skills are a big plus. In light of the OECD's new outward orientation,

development or developing country experience and entrée with Chinese, Indian, and Brazilian
interlocutors would also be advantageous. To the extent possible, the USG should seek diverse
candidates, particularly women, to fill the position.

4. (SBU) The United States must act quickly to identify and advocate for a single nominee or

a very short list of preferred candidates. USOECD and Washington officials should begin
selling that choice to key Member states and preparing the ground with the Secretary General
early in 2013. Gurria, in his inimitable style, would certainly fill any vacuum by choosing and

lobbying strongly for his hand-picked American DSG (whoever that might be). A cautionary
tale: mission officers were told that DSG Rintaro Tamaki, who arrived in 2011, was not the
Government of Japan's choice. Rather, the Secretary General presented Tamaki to members as

a fait accompli. Tamaki is a capable, thoughtful, and intelligent man, but defers to Gurria. He
has been a "low-impact" DSG, especially on important development-related issues. Belgian
Yves Leterme has also failed to make his mark in his first year. Pier Carlo Padoan — the Italian

DSG who is also the OECD's Chief Economist and leads the Economic Directorate — was
sidelined in the important "New Challenges to Economic Challenges" discussions despite
being a highly regarded economist . In contrast, Boucher has been dynamic, focused, and

proactive as he pursues engagement with emerging economic powers and enlargement -
exactly what the OECD needs to remain modern and relevant (per QDDR instructions
regarding multilateral organizations). He serves Gurria well, but is no shrinking violet.

    (SBU) Comment: Mission urges serious State and interagency action to identify best
5.
candidates to replace Boucher so that we will be in the driver's seat on this selection. As the
"face" of OECD's outreach to emerging economies and developing countries, this position is

challenging and offers the potential to deeply enhance the organization's global
relevance. End comment.

DSG who is also the OECD's Chief Economist and leads the Economic Directorate — was
sidelined in the important "New Challenges to Economic Challenges" discussions despite

being a highly regarded economist . In contrast, Boucher has been dynamic, focused, and
 proactive as he pursues engagement with emerging economic powers and enlargement -

 exactly what the OECD needs to remain modern and relevant (per QDDR instructions

 regarding multilateral organizations). He serves Gurria well, but is no shrinking violet.

 5. (SBU) Comment: Mission urges serious State and interagency action to identify best
 candidates to replace Boucher so that we will be in the driver's seat on this selection. As the

 "face" of OECD's outreach to emerging economies and developing countries, this position is

 challenging and offers the potential to deeply enhance the organization's global
 relevance. End comment.

   uilding Haiti's Economy, One Mango at a Time

By PAUL COLLIER and JEAN-LOUIS WARNHOLZ

IN an astonishing outpouring of generosity, nearly half of American households have

donated money to help Haiti recover from the recent earthquake. The United States
government and other governments around the world, for their part, have sent thousands

of relief workers and have pledged 5$i billion so far. But Haitians need something more
fundamental than relief from the present situation; they need jobs that they can count on

for years ahead. For this, the private business sector is essential. Luckily, business leaders
are meeting now in Davos, Switzerland, and Haiti is prominent on their agenda.

Haiti is by far the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, and yet it need not be so,

because unexploited economic opportunities abound there. Some of the best mangoes in
the world grow in Haiti — though too many of them rot, offshore from the world's largest

market, for want of adequate roads and well-governed ports. Excellent coffee is grown in
the Haitian mountains, but much of it is sold informally across the border to coffee

producers in the Dominican Republic, who reap most of the profits.

Haiti also has many qualities attractive to tourists: a warm climate; magnificent white-
sand beaches and turquoise water; Tortuga, the famous pirate island off the northern

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766548 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

coast; and the Citadel, a mountain fortress erected after Haiti's independence in the early
19th century to fend off colonial powers, now a World Heritage site. Still, it is one of the
least visited places in the Caribbean.

The Hope II trade pact with the United States, signed in 2008, granted Haiti duty-free

access to the American apparel market for the next decade. Already, as a result of the deal,
many garment factories situated along Haiti's eastern border (so as to use Dominican
electricity and ports) have become profitable and competitive with Chinese garment
makers. But light manufacturing could be much bigger in Haiti — if the Haitian
government and donors would credibly commit to providing functioning roads, electrical

grids and ports, and if outside private capital would invest, patiently, in Haitian
businesses.

Poverty and a history of coups and trade embargoes have pushed Haiti's reputation as a
place to do business to near the bottom of the global pile, alongside countries like
Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq. But Haiti is far safer and offers far more market

opportunities than those conflict-ridden nations.

The obvious difficulty in Haiti is that its economic center, Port-au-Prince, is now in
shambles. Private investors are naturally wary of jumping into a market too soon, before it
is lively enough to provide certain kinds of support. After all, many businesses can be
profitable only if other businesses exist alongside them. Ships don't sail directly from Haiti

to Florida because there aren't enough goods to warrant dedicated routes. In the
meantime, without reliable routes for direct export of goods, investment in production in
Haiti is stymied.

Even within a single manufacturing sector, it helps to have many businesses operating
together. Garment factories, for example, cluster together, because they share a common

need for support services. In Haiti, the cluster of garment makers has been too small even
to keep repair shops in business; it can take weeks to fly in a technician to fix a broken
sewing machine. So, production costs are high because there are too few investors, and
there are too few investors because costs are so high.

The way to address this chicken-and-egg problem is for individual private investors to

coordinate with one another. This would not be a new strategy; in the 19th century, the
American West was developed not as a process of gradual diffusion but in spasms of local
investment booms, financed by enthusiastic outsiders. The earthquake could usher in such
a boom in Haiti.

The World Economic Forum in Davos provides an opportunity for businesses that might
invest in Haiti — international fashion brands, hotels and coffee chains, for example — to

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766548 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

coordinate with companies that provide logistics and markets, so that together they could
make mutual commitments. The foundation for such coordination has already been laid —
by Bill Clinton, who led 200 international investors to Haiti last October. As a result of this

effort, international chains like Best Western and Choice Hotels started building new
hotels in Haiti.

The earthquake has, of course, changed opportunities in Haiti, but it has not necessarily
reduced them. The American construction industry is mired in deep recession and so has

the excess capacity to meet Haiti's sudden need for low-cost housing, roads, bridges and
other structures. If American construction firms can harness Haitian labor to reconstruct
(safer) homes, then the challenge will be to lure other businesses in their wake so that
temporary jobs in reconstruction are replaced by long-term jobs in manufacturing,

agriculture and tourism.

In meeting this challenge, banks and private venture capital also have an important role to
play. Haiti needs generous venture capital that encourages some firms to move in first.
George Soros , the investor and philanthropist, has recognized this need by committing
$25 million for smart investments that catalyze Haiti's competitive advantages. Many

more such commitments are needed.

For now,  even public sources of risk capital like the World Bank's International Finance
Corporation and Britain's Commonwealth Development Corporation have no special
provision for the kind of coordinated pump-priming investment that's required in Haiti.

Most public capital goes to emerging market economies where private investment no
longer needs to be encouraged. Haiti, with its genuine opportunities and immediate needs,
provides a chance for public finance organizations to find new relevance. It is also a chance
for private business to show it can take a major role in meeting the gravest human needs.

Paul Collier, an economics professor at Oxford, was a special adviser on Haiti to the

United Nations secretary general in 2009. Jean-Louis Warnholz, the managing director
of a business consulting company, was an economic adviser to Haiti's prime minister in
2009.

It is being reported that she (Coulter) was in Haiti before with Silsby:
(From AFP: Judge Bernard Saint-vil, who is handling the case, allowed them to leave the country without bail, according to their

All-

Below is the statement for spox to release for after the flight goes wheels up. I will let you know when that happens. We anticipate
around 8:30pm. CA has reached out to HHS who will be receiving the plane and they will help keep media away from the AmCits and
facilitate entry. Once they arrive in Miami it is up to them to get to their destination.

Thanks,
Caitlin

Today, the Haitian judge released eight of the ten American citizens and they have departed Haiti for the United
 States. Two members of the group are being detained in Haiti to answer further questions, as the investigation is
ongoing. The United State Government respects the sovereign right of the Government of Haiti to conduct its

own judicial processes. The United States Embassy in Port au Prince has been providing the detained
Americans with consular visits and assistance to ensure that they are safe and receiving necessary care. Haitian
authorities have been cooperative in ensuring the individuals' safety and welfare since their arrest and we have

 every expectation this will continue.

Time to break the fog of Middle East politics

By David Ignatius
Sunday, March 21, 2010; A19
Diplomats love ambiguity. It allows them to fuzz up the hard parts of a negotiation -- the "final status" issues, as they're
often called -- and save them for later, when the parties are more amenable to pressure.
This devotion to "constructive ambiguity" has been a hallmark of U.S. peacemaking on the Palestinian-Israeli issue for 40

years. Rather than state the unpalatable concessions that most analysts recognize will be required for any viable
settlement -- that Israelis must share sovereignty in Jerusalem and that Palestinians must give up the "right of return" to
Israel -- successive U.S. administrations have tried to defer these unmentionables until later.
But the fog machine blew apart this month, when the isr3e1Interipr i‘,1!inista_rndLinced du                 ..ripq.visit ily__Vde President

Biden that Israel would build 1,600 more housipg priits in           	     ,lerusal.erp. The Obama administration was upset, to put it
mildly: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the housing announcement a "deeply negative signal" about U.S.-Israeli
relations and "an insult."
In the ensuing hubbub over the "crisis" in U.S.-Israeli relations, there have been frantic attempts to pretend it was all a
misunderstanding and pull the cloak of ambiguity back over the peace process. But that's a mistake.

 The East Jerusalem move wasn't an accident but an emphatic public statement of the Israeli right's rejection of
 concessions on Jerusalem. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had been trying to play along with U.S. requests to fuzz
 the issue by avoiding provocative actions on Jerusalem. But the right-wing Shas party, which controls the Interior Ministry,
 basically called his bluff.
 "Freezing building in East Jerusalem is one of those things we cannot do," said Dore Gold, a right-wing former Israeli

 ambassador to the United Nations. And Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli foreign minister and a settler himself, responded:
 "Can you imagine if they told Jews in New York they could not build or buy in Queens?"
 So what should the administration do, now that the Israeli right has put Jerusalem squarely on the table despite the best
 efforts of the ambiguity-addicted diplomats?

 The administration's best strategy is to do what it considered a year ago, which is to state clearly the basic principles that
 must frame these negotiations. Those guidelines have been articulated well by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national
 security adviser: real sharing of Jerusalem; no right of return for the Palestinians; a return to the 1967 borders, with mutual
 adjustments to allow for big Israeli settlement blocks; and a demilitarized Palestinian state. Every negotiation for the past

 four decades has converged toward those parameters.
 The Obama administration debated whether to issue such a statement of principles a year ago, when it began its
 peacemaking effort. Launching negotiations with this "big bang" made sense to some officials, including Gen. Jim Jones,
 the national security adviser, But George Mitchell, the Middle East envoy, argued that based on his experience in the
 Northern Ireland peace talks, it was better to let the parties haggle before the United States stepped in with bridging

 proposals.
 Rather than stating U.S. negotiating principles at the outset, the Obama team decided instead to push Netanyahu on
 settlements. The administration picked this fight in the flush of President Obama's first months in office, confident that he

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768492 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

was so strong and Netanyahu so weak that if it came to a showdown, Netanyahu would cave. The Israeli leader coolly

bided his time, dickering about procedural issues while Obama got weaker politically by the month. Netanyahu finally
agreed in November to a temporary moratorium on new settlements -- but it excluded Jerusalem. The administration
should have seen what was coming.
In retrospect, it seems clear that the step-by-step approach was a mistake: Constructive ambiguity, in this case, proved
destructive. It allowed the Israeli right wing to perpetuate the idea that it could have it all -- obtain a peace deal without

making concessions on Jerusalem. And it allowed Netanyahu to continue his straddle.
Jerusalem is the hardest issue of all in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiation, and for that reason, would-be peacemakers
have wanted to save it for last. But this month's crisis makes that strategic waffling impossible. Thanks to the Israeli right,
the Jerusalem issue is joined.
What's needed now is for Obama to announce that when negotiations begin, the United States will state its views about
Jerusalem and other key issues -- sketching the outlines of the deal that most Israelis and Palestinians want. If Netanyahu

refuses to play, then we have a real crisis in U.S.-Israeli relations.

            Congress, but I strongly believe this budget request is critical to advancing U.S.

            national security and our interests around the world.

                   Our request totals $52.8 billion — a $4.9 billion increase over 2010. Of that
            increase, $3.6 billion goes directly to "frontline states" — Afghanistan, Pakistan,

            and Iraq. All other State and USAID funding grows by $1.3 billion or a 2.7
             percent increase, and allows us to tackle the transnational problems of poverty.
             food insecurity, climate change, and disease that pose serious threats to American
             interests.

                   Our diplomatic and development tools alliance American leadership,
            strengthen our alliances, and build new partnerships to confront pressing global

             challenges. Full fimding in FY 11 will allow (LS to continue making tangible
             progress in securing the hard fought gains achieved in 'Iraq, and to continue
            supporting and deploying hundreds of civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan to help.

             diplomats and development professionals are on the front lines, protecting. and

             securing our vital national security interests around the world.

                   Congress has rightly demanded that we use all the tools in our national
             security tool belt; that we put more diplomats and development experts on the

             ground, shoulder-to-shoulder with our troops; and that we do everything possible
             to secure America's interests aroun.d the world.. We are doing our part at the State
             Department and USAID, but we need your help with the FY II request. Our

            missions are increasingly integrated with those of our Defense Department
            counterparts, as we have seen demonstrated time and again in Iraq, Afghanistan,

            and other parts of the world. Cuts to the civilian components can no longer be seen
            in isolation or having little impact on our national security strategy.
                   Our investments in development and diplemacy are smart, cost-effective,

            and squarely in the best interests of American taxpayers and our national security.
            They are also relatively small compared to the cost of active military engagement,

            and they can end up delivering impactful savings. In Iraq, lbr example, our $2.6
            billion request for State and USAID will allow the Defense Department budget to
            decrease by about $16 billion — a powerful illustration of the return on civilian

            investments.

                   I ask ibr your strong support of our budget request and you have my pledge
            that we will work diligently to ensure that this funding is used as efficiently and
            effectively as possible.

                                                     Sincerely yours,

                         for proving that you don't need to be president to act presidential.

                                         FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORK

                                      SECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTON

Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September, Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a        confident note:

"After years of war and uncertainty, people are wondering what the future holds, at home and abroad. So let me say

it clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century."

Ironically, two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president and

the ex-would-be-president, the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power.

Except that, these days, both Clintons are more influential, and more beloved, than ever. Bill's Clinton Global

Initiative is starting to feel like a sexier, more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itself,

bringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based, technocratic

solutions. As of this summer, his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort to

rebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president, and he

spent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle.

Meanwhile, Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States, an

accolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin's

temper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions, promoting women's rights over the

objections of entrenched traditionalists, and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world's

poorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence, with her Quadrennial Diplomacy and

Development Review a major, if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this is

what Clinton nostalgia looks like, bring it on.

STATEMENT BYSECRETARYCLINTON

The Cancun Agreements

Over the last year, the United States has worked with our international partners to build on the progress achieved at the
climate change conference in Copenhagen. We have pressed for substantive steps that would advance the vision of the

Copenhagen Accord. This month we joined the nations of the world in Cancun for a new round of talks aimed at
mobilizing common action to meet the shared global challenge of climate change.

Today I am pleased to announce that we secured the Cancun Agreements, a set of balanced international decisions

under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) which represent meaningful progress in
our global response to climate change.

These agreements advance each of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord: They anchor the Accord's mitigation

pledges; build on a system of transparency with substantial detail and content of International Consultations and
Analysis which will provide confidence that a country's pledges are being carried out; launch a new Green Climate Fund;

create a framework to reduce deforestation in developing countries; establish a technology mechanism; and Setup a
framework and committee to will promote international cooperation and action on adaptation.

The Cancun Agreements represent a balanced and significant step forward. In the days and months ahead, the United

States will work with our friends and partners to keep the world focused on this urgent challenge and to continue
building on this progress.

   Re: US mentor to Egyptian revolutionaries
</span>

   The New York Times today discloses that youthful non-violent Egyptian revolutionaries have

   been inspired by the work of an American political thinker on non-violent resistance, Gene
   Sharp, who spent decades at Harvard. (See NYT article and bio of Sharp below.)

   You might consider inviting him to see you and then sending him on a State Department USIS
   tour.

   NYT:

   Breaking free from older veterans of the Arab political opposition, they relied on tactics of
   nonviolent resistance channeled from an American scholar through a Serbian youth brigade —
   but also on marketing tactics borrowed from Silicon Valley.

   For their part, Mr. Maher and his colleagues began reading about nonviolent struggles. They
   were especially drawn to a Serbian youth movementcalled Otpor,which had helped topple the
   dictatorSlobodan Milosevic by drawing on the ideas of an American political thinGene
   Sharp. The hallmark of Mr. Sharp's work is well-tailored to Mr. Mubark's Egypt: He argues that
   nonviolence is a singularly effective way to undermine police sthat might cite violent
   resistance to justin; repression in the name of stability.

   Dual Uprisings Show Potent New Threats to

   Arab States

   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and DAVID E. SANGER

   CAIRO — As protesters in Tahrir Square faced off against pro-government forces, they drew a
    lesson from their counterparts in Tunisia: "Advice to the youth of Egypt: Put vinegar or onion
    under your scarf for tear gas."

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778771 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

  In Washington that day, President Obama turned up, unexpectedly, at a 3:30 p.m. Situation
  Room meeting of his "principals," the key members of the national security team, where he
  displaced Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, from his seat at the head of the table.

  The White House had been debating the likelihood of a domino effect since youth-driven revolts
  had toppled President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia, even though the American intelligence
  community and Israel's intelligence services had estimated that the risk to President Mubarak
  was low — less than 20 percent, some officials said.

  According to senior officials who participated in Mr. Obama's policy debates, the president took
  a different view. He made the point early on, a senior official said, that "this was a trend" that
  could spread to other authoritarian governments in the region, including in Iran. By the end of
  the 18-day uprising, by a White House count, there were 38 meetings with the president about
  Egypt. Mr. Obama said that this was a chance to create an alternative to "the Al Qaeda narrative"

  of Western interference.

  American officials had seen no evidence of overtly anti-American or anti-Western sentiment.
  "When we saw people bringing their children to Tahrir Square, wanting to see history being
  made, we knew this was something different," one official said.

  On Jan. 28, the debate quickly turned to how to pressure Mr. Mubarak in private and in public —
  and whether Mr. Obama should appear on television urging change. Mr. Obama decided to call
  Mr. Mubarak, and several aides listened in on the line. Mr. Obama did not suggest that the 82-
  year-old leader step aside or transfer power. At this point, "the argument was that he really
  needed to do the reforms, and do them fast," a senior official said. Mr. Mubarak resisted, saying
  the protests were about outside interference.

  According to the official, Mr. Obama told him, "You have a large portion of your people who are
  not satisfied, and they won't be until you make concrete political, social and economic reforms."

  The next day, the decision was made to send former Ambassador Frank G. Wisner to Cairo as an
  envoy. Mr. Obama began placing calls to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Prime

 Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and other regional leaders.

 The most difficult calls, officials said, were with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Mr.
 Netanyahu, who feared regional instability and urged the United States to stick with Mr.
 Mubarak. According to American officials, senior members of the government in Saudi Arabia
 argued that the United States should back Mr. Mubarak even if lieused force against the

 demonstrators. By Feb. 1, when Mr. Mubarak broadcast a speech pledging that he would not run
 again and that elections would be held in September, Mr. Obama concluded that the Egyptian
 president still had not gotten the message.

 Within an hour, Mr. Obama called Mr. Mubarak again in the toughest, and last, of their
 conversations. "He said if this transition process drags out for months, the protests will, too," one

 of Mr. Obama's aides said.

 Mr. Mubarak told Mr. Obama that the protests would be over in a few days.

 Mr. Obama ended the call, the official said, with these words: "I respect my elders. And you
 have been in politics for a very long time, Mr. President. But there are moments in history when

 just because things were the same way in the past doesn't mean they will be that way in the
 future."
