U.S. MUST LEAD GLOBAL RESPONSE
TO FAMINE IN HORN OF AFRICA

M. Speaker -

Last week, the United Nations declared famine in Somalia and reported urgent needs in Ethiopia and Kenya. On our
nightly TV news and daily papers, we are seeing the pictures of people dying, of children suffering extreme malnutrition,

and mothers carrying their babies walking over a hundred miles in search of food and safe haven.

Tens of thousands of people in Somalia have already died. The Horn of Africa is suffering a devastating drought, with
this year being recorded in some locations as the driest or second driest year on record since 1951. The impact has been
compounded by war, neglect and spiraling food prices.

Currently, some 11.5 million people across East Africa urgently need food aid, medical supplies and care. More than

130,000 Somali refugees have left their country for refugee camps along the borders of Ethiopia and Kenya. They arrive
exhausted and physically depleted. News reports estimate that about 1300 Somali refugees arrive in northern Kenya

every single day. They join already overcrowded camps, and stress the ability of the Kenyan government and
humanitarian agencies to provide food, water, emergency care and shelter.

Working with local partners and NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children and Italian Aid, UNICEF will

be vaccinating hundreds of thousands of children. Dehydrated and suffering from malnutrition, these children -

especially those under the age of five - are particularly susceptible to the measles, polio, diarrhea and pneumonia.

To date, in fiscal year 2011, the United States has provided over $450 million in humanitarian aid to the Horn of Africa

through USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and the Food for Peace Program, along with refugee assistance
from the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.

But much more needs to be done. The next three to six months will be critical. The drought is expected to worsen, at

least through the end of the year. And then we will wait to see what happens during the next cycle of rains. Will

communities be able to recover? Will small farmers be able to plant new crops? Or will heavy rains produce floods that
drive communities deeper into poverty?

My colleagues need to understand, however, that the current crisis, terrible as it is, could have been much worse.

There is good news amongst so much tragedy. The last time a drought of this magnitude hit Ethiopia, over 14 million
people faced starvation. This time, about 4.5 million Ethiopians are in need of emergency aid. The difference? Since

2005, the United States and other donors have made significant investments in Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net
Program.

I saw first-hand several of these programs in 2007. They help small farmers and poor communities diversify the crops

they planted, broaden their sources of income, create local markets, better manage their water resources, and increase

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05781563 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

the nutritional content of their own diets and those of their children. This has enabled over 7.5 million Ethiopians to

withstand the worst effects of the current drought. These families and communities are NOT part of the 4.5 million
Ethiopians who require urgent humanitarian aid.

These programs work. They were models for Feed the Future, our current global program to promote sustainable

agriculture, food security and nutrition. It's how you end global hunger, M. Speaker. It's the difference between
needing to help rescue 4 million people rather than 14 million. It's also the difference between investing $6.00 per

person each year so they become more food secure and resilient to disasters - or having to invest $250 per person to
deliver emergency relief that only covers three to four months.

It's the smart way to invest our development resources. This is why I'm so appalled by what happened yesterday in the

mark-up of the State/Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill. Development, humanitarian, and disaster aid programs
were all brutally cut. These cuts come on top of the Agricultural Appropriations Bill that devastated our emergency food

aid programs.

With the worst drought in 60 years hitting the Horn of Africa, these cuts amount to the U.S. turning its back on its own
strategic interests and walking away from our international commitments.

Instead, we need to increase our emergency response to the current crisis, ensure we have the resources to invest in
long-term development, and continue our global leadership in ending hunger and famine once and for all.

We need to do better, M. Speaker.

By His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa

On Feb. 14, the winds of change that are sweeping the region hit the shores of Bahrain. Demands for well-
paying jobs, transparency in economic affairs and access to better social services were received with good will.
There is no doubt that grievances about civil andpolitical rights for all Bahrainis are legitimate. Inresponse, we
offeredanunconditional dialogue withthe oppositionso as to maintainthe stability of our country andaddress

thedemands forreform.

Unfortunately, the legitimate demands of the opposition were hijacked by extremist elements with ties to
foreign governments in the region. It became very clear that the stability, safety and economic viability of our
country were being threatened. We tookimmediate actionto stabilize the situationandat the same time

welcomed the entry of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) troops, whose task was not to suppress the protesters -
as some of our neighbors have alleged - but to protect the essential and crucial facilities and installations in
Bahrain.

At that moment, we hadto make a decisionnot just for the stability andsafety of our countrymenbut also for
the region. Bahrainlies at the epicenter of Gulf security andany violent upheaval inBahrainwouldhave

enormous geopolitical consequences. Global economic stability depends on the uninterrupted export of crude
oil fromthe Gulf to markets aroundthe world- a jobthat historically has beenassignedto the U.S. FifthFleet.
Seventy percent of the world's remaining oil reserves are inthe Gulf andmore than30 percent of the oil from
theregionflows throughtheterritorial waters of Bahrain.

The Gulf countries, for their part, shoulder the responsibilitytoprotect these reserves andensure the safetyand
security of the oil tankers andthe oil pipelines that carry themto the world. These pipelines extendthousands of
kilometers throughout theArabianPeninsula.

Todaywe are tryingveryhardtoimprove the process of reformandrectifythose problems that have arisen

along the way. Sectarian divide has created a schismin our society that is a major challenge. As monarch of all
Bahrainis, it pains me to see many harmedby the actions of a few. Andyet I amoptimistic andhave faithinour
people. We all realize that nowis the time to strike a balance betweenstability andgradual reform, always
adheringtothe universal values of humanrights, free expressionandreligious tolerance. I amconfident that we
canstrike this balance incooperationwithour long-time friendandally, the UnitedStates, producingan

outcome that will preserve the aspirations of our youngdemocracyintransition.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05781553 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

Along with our friends in the GCC, the first order of business is stability. Beyond the imperative of stability, the

most important priority is job creation for all Bahrainis.

We invite American companies looking to raise capital to list on the Bahrain Stock Exchange (BSE). The region
has a liquidity oversupply approximating $1 trillion and this pool of capital can be tapped into by creative

American companies. The next Facebook may very well get funded on the BSE.

An important element of job creation is the enactment of a GCC "Marshal Plan" for Bahrain. Our neighbors -
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates - can take a lead role in funding infrastructure and

energy projects. For example, Qatar can fast-track the construction of the much touted Bahrain-Qatar causeway.
This will allow for immediate employment of hundreds of Bahrainis.

An integral element of any support for Bahrain should be a scholarship program for Bahrainis from all walks of
life to obtain their undergraduate and graduate degrees in the United States. Education is the best investment our

GCC neighbors can make in the future of Bahrain. The rationale is simple: The prerequisite to better paying
jobs is a world-class education. This investment will allow our citizens not only the opportunity to bring their
skills back to Bahrain and put it to productive use, but also allow them to gain meaningful employment within
the GCC.

Last but not least, we would welcome a joint U.S.-GCC effort to fund and implement a training program in the
United States for new recruits to the Bahraini police force and army.

When I was a student at the Army War College in Ft. Leavenworth, Kan., it was very clear to me that the
American
           experience was a model well worth emulating. The events that have unfolded since February offer
new opportunities for both of our countries.

I Tweet for Freedom

By James Kitfield

June 29, 201116:00 a.m.

If there is a single lesson that can already be distilled from the Arab Spring democracy movements sweeping through the Middle East, it
is this: social media is mightier than the sword. Despots who once ruled in blacked-out realms are now challenged by flash mobs
organized over the interne and wielding thousands of cell phone portals to the outside world.

Under its "21st Century Diplomacy" initiative, the State Department has taken a proactive stance in arming those masses with advanced
communications gear and training. With millions of dollars of grants, for instance, State has been financing "stealth wireless networks,"
mobile "internet in a suitcase" systems, and software that protects the anonymity of cell phone and internet users in places like Iran,
Libya, Syria, and China. State Department officials consider the initiatives a natural extension of long-standing programs to advance
freedom of speech through Voice of America broadcasts. In an interview with National Journal, Under Secretary of State Judith
McHale, the former president of Discovery Communications, discussed those initiatives. Edited excerpts of the interview follow.

NJ: Why is it in the United States' interests to challenge state censorship of free expression, even in nations with
whom we have close or at least cordial relations?

McHale: [Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton has been very clear, consistent and vocal in articulating U.S. support for freedom of

expression. We think it's important that people be allowed to raise their voices in debate, and to have an independent media. Freedom
to access information and express opinions is a core American value. We think it is a fundamental right, and thus it helps drive
 everything that we do. Not only have President Obama and Secretary Clinton given speeches on the subject, but we raise it in our private

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780881 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

conversations with governments around the world. We believe it is in their self-interest to allow freedom of expression. Now obviously
not all of them agree with us, but I think repressive regimes are losing that battle.

NJ:  Do you see events in the Middle East as proving the point?

McHale: Well, look at Egypt, where the government tried to shut down the internet in reaction to protests. That didn't last very long. In
today's communications environment, people will increasingly find a way to exercise their fundamental right of expression. Because we
believe it is a fundamental human right, we have also given a number of grants to people who are looking for ways for activists and
others to circumvent the technology that repressive regimes use to stifle communication, and to circumvent barriers that governments
erect to the exercise of free speech. That's consistent with the Voice of America's mission to broadcast into Eastern Europe during the
Cold War, to counter the lack of reliable information there.

NJ:  Has there been blowback from nations who see that as meddling in their internal affairs?

McHale: Well, it has upset some governments, just as Voice of America angered some nations, but that's not a reason to stop doing it.

We'll continue to raise the issue of freedom of expression in our private discussions with other governments, and we'll continue to
publicly provide the tools and resources necessary for people to exercise their fundamental human right of free expression. In fact, we're
not only seeding activists with new technology and circumvention tools, we're training them how to use those tools while protecting
themselves from government reprisals. This is the21St century version of what we accomplished with all of those Voice of America
broadcasts, and itgoes to the heart of what we're trying to do.

NJ:  So the tweet really is mightier than the sword?

McHale: I think that's probably true. Clearly the ability to communicate, share ideas, and share strategies has played a key role in the
Arab Spring democracy movements. That's not to say Twitter caused the revolution. Absent the underlying problems of injustice I doubt
we'd be where we are today. There's also a dark side to this technology, because repressive regimes will be just as sophisticated in using
these tools and technologies to suppress communication and expression.

NJ:  In what other ways have these technologies impacted U.S. public diplomacy?

 McHale: With the proliferation of information technology across all societies, people around the world are participating in shaping the
 political lives of their countries to an unprecedented degree. That drove us to an understanding that the United States government had
to take a different approach to public diplomacy. For centuries, traditional diplomacy was conducted on a government-to-government
 basis through negotiations. That continues to be a critical component of diplomacy. We need to complement it, however, with a new
 outreach to populations that are increasingly involved in their governments' decisions. If we don't strengthen those relationships then
 we can't meet our foreign policy objectives or, frankly, assure our own security. That meant we needed to find ways to engagellion
 people around the world. It's hard to shake all of their hands, so we had to look for new ways to engage them.

 NJ: How do you shape a consistent narrative when addressing so many different audiences?

 McHale: Shaping a narrative in today's world means understanding that the media landscape has changed dramatically. People talk of a
 'technological revolution,' but it's now years old, so this new world is here to stay, and it requires us to react to events very quickly.
 We've had to move beyond just pushing out press releases, for instance, to engaging proactively and broadly across both traditional and
 social media. If we don't respond quickly to an inaccurate story, for instance, we will never get beyond it, because they live forever on
 the internet. I have a 16-person Center for Strategic Counter-Terrorism Communications, for example, that rapidly responds to any
 message from al-Qaida that we see online, and is willing to explain and debate the American position on violent extremism.

 The larger point is that in the world of social media, if you don't provide a context for what you're doing, other people will interpret your
 actions for you. That's why this morning I met with 30 plus bloggers from around the world, who have an expectation that I will engage

 with them in dialogue. I have200 folks at the State Department focused solely on social media, and around 1,000 employees worldwide
 who have social media as a large component of their jobs. We produce loo foreign language Twitter feeds. That's the character of 21st
 century diplomacy.

 NJ:  So is improving America's image and countering widespread anti-Americanism just a matter of better messaging
 and adept use of social media?

 McHale: No, it can't just be about messaging. If we're sitting here in Washington, D.C., and trying to figure out what foreign policy will
 or will not work in Tunisia, for instance, no amount of messaging is going to help. Messaging divorced from informed policymaldng will
 fail.

 NJ: Despite all of your hard work, how do you explain polls that show the U.S. is still profoundly unpopular in many
 parts of the world?

 McHale: While I would push back against the idea that we are unpopular everywhere, certainly we operate in a very challenging
 environment. Some of the unpopularity goes with being such a large, powerful nation. Sometimes it results from policies that we pursue
 in our national interests that are disliked abroad. Other times it results from ignorance or misconceptions. Even in especially
 challenging areas like the Middle East, however, we find there are areas where people are eager to work with the United States, such as
 science, education, and entrepreneurship. So we can't be so focused on poll numbers that we lose sight of areas of potential cooperation.

 in our national interests that are disliked abroad. Other times it results from ignorance or misconceptions. Even in especially
 challenging areas like the Middle East, however, we find there are areas where people are eager to work with the United States, such as
 science, education, and entrepreneurship. So we can't be so focused on poll numbers that we lose sight of areas of potential cooperation.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Exploiting its huge geographical reach, Russia will try to build energy and investment

ties with Asia and forge better relations with the United States at a weekend summit of countries on the Pacific
Rim.

   Top of President Dmitry Medvedev's agenda is a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama, who hosts the

gathering of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group in Hawaii.

   Medvedev and Obama have made headway in mending ties strained by Russia's 2008 war with Georgia and
signed a nuclear arms control pact in April 2010.

   But persisting disputes and presidential elections next year in both countries undermine the chances of
progress in the "reset" of Russia-U.S. relations before Medvedev makes way for Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
to return as president.

    Kremlin economic adviser Arkady Dvorkovich suggested there was still wariness on both sides of the former
Cold War divide.

    "The reset has already happened at the highest political level, but not in the heads of everyone," Dvorkovich
said.

    He said Russia was getting negative signals from the U.S. Congress, where Obama's Republican opponents

accuse him of not being tough enough on Russia, and indicated there was similar sentiment about the United
States in Russia's parliament.

    The two presidents are likely to welcome a hard-won deal sealed this week by Russia and Georgia that

opened the way for Russia to join the World Trade Organization.

    But their meeting will be overshadowed by disagreement over U.S. plans for a European missile shield,
which Russia says could threaten its security, and by differences over Arab world unrest from Libya to Syria.

    Russia and China, which is also attending the summit, vetoed a U.S.-backed Security Council resolution last
 month condemning Syria's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.

    The two leaders could also disagree on Iran after a report by the United Nations' nuclear energy watchdog

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05783142 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

deepened Western suspicions that Tehran is trying to develop atomic weapons. Russia opposes new sanctions

on Iran.

Tripoli, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador returned to work in Libya on Thursday, raising the U.S. flag

over a re-opened embassy, a month after Muammar Gaddafi was driven from power with the help of a NATO-
led bombing campaign.

   Gene Cretz pledged support for Libya's transitional government and said he expected the last Gaddafi

loyalists to lay down their arms imminently.

   The forces of the interim Transitional National Council (TNC) are confronting stiff resistance in the last
strongholds of Gaddafi loyalists, and the provisional leadership faces questions about whether it can unify a

country divided on tribal and local lines.

   Seeking to bolster Libya's new leaders, President Barack Obama said this week Cretz would return to Tripoli
and "the American flag that was lowered before our embassy was attacked will be raised again."

   The embassy building was ransacked by a mob of Gaddafi supporters before Tripoli was taken over by
forces loyal to the new government.

   "I think it is a matter of time before Gaddafi and his remaining loyalists, their resistance is finished," Cretz
told reporters at a ceremony to mark the re-opening of the U.S. mission.

    The White House felt vindicated in its approach to Libya when rebel forces took Tripoli late last month.

    It had faced criticism for an initially slow response to the Libyan uprising and then set strict limits on the
U.S. role in the NATO air assault, which was officially described as a means of stopping the massacre of
civilians.

    Obama this week met Mustafa Abdul Jalil, chairman of Libya's National Transitional Council (NTC) when
he and interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril came to the United States for the United Nations General
Assembly.

    The U.S. president held out promise the United   States would build new partnerships with Libya, a top oil
producer.

    Cretz praised the NTC for its efforts to date, but said the formation of new institutions may be drawn out, as
 regional tensions and frictions between Islamists and those who envision a secular state come to the fore in a

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05783248 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

new Libyan politics.

    "These are splits and fractures in the body politic that are a result of 42 years of mismanagement by
Muammar Gaddafi," Cretz said. "There is an East-West problem, the problem of the old regime versus the new

regime, the problem of the potential challenge of the Islamists."

    "I expect when Mr. Abdel Jalil and Mr. fibril come from their journey to the U.N., the process will begin in

earnest. But it will take what it takes."

I Twe t for Free om

By James Kiffield

June 29, 201116.00 a.m.

If there is a single lesson that can already be distilled from the Arab Spring democracy movements sweeping through the Middle East, it
is this: social media is mightier than the sword. Despots who once ruled in blacked-out realms are now challenged by flash mobs
organized over the internet and wielding thousands of cell phone portals to the outside world.

Under its "21st Century Diplomacy" initiative, the State Department has taken a proactive stance in arming those masses with advanced
communications gear and training. With millions of dollars of grants, for instance, State has been financing "stealth wireless networks,"
mobile "internet in a suitcase" systems, and software that protects the anonymity of cell phone and internet users in places like Iran,
Libya, Syria, and China. State Department officials consider the initiatives a natural extension of long-standing programs to advance
freedom of speech through Voice of America broadcasts. In an interview wNational Journal,Under Secretary of State Judith
McHale, the former president of Discovery Communications, discussed those initiatives. Edited excerpts of the interview follow.

NJ: Why is it in the United States' interests to challenge state censorship of free expression, even in nations with
whom we have close or at least cordial relations?

McHale: [Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton has been very clear, consistent and vocal in articulating U.S. support for freedom of
expression. We think it's important that people be allowed to raise their voices in debate, and to have an independent media. Freedom
to access information and express opinions is a core American value. We think it is a fundamental right, and thus it helps drive
everything that we do. Not only have President Obama and Secretary Clinton given speeches on the subject, but we raise it in our private
conversations with governments around the world. We believe it is in their self-interest to allow freedom of expression. Now obviously
not all of them agree with us, Ithink repressive regimes are losing that battle.

NJ: Do you see events in the Middle East as proving the point?

McHale: Well, look at Egypt, where the government tried to shut down the internet in reaction to protests. That didn't last very long. In
today's communications environment, people will increasingly find a way to exercise their fundamental right of expression. Because we
believe it is a fundamental human right, we have also given a number of grants to people who are looking for ways for activists and
others to circumvent the technology that repressive regimes use to stifle communication, and to circumvent barriers that governments

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05786484 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

erect to the exercise of free speech. That's consistent with the Voice of America's mission to broadcast into Eastern Europe during the
Cold War, to counter the lack of reliable information there.

NJ: Has there been blowback from nations who see that as meddling in their internal affairs?

McHale: Well, it has upset some governments, just as Voice of America angered some nations, but that's not a reason to stop doing it.
We'll continue to raise the issue of freedom of expression in our private discussions with other governments, and we'll continue to
publicly provide the tools and resources necessary for people to exercise their fundamental human right of free expression. In fact, we're
not only seeding activists with new technology and circumvention tools, we're training them how to use those tools while protecting
themselves from government reprisals. This is the list century version of what we accomplished with all of those Voice of America
broadcasts, and it goes to the heart of what we're trying to do.

NJ: So the tweet really is mightier than the sword?

McHale: I think that's probably true. Clearly the ability to communicate, share ideas, and share strategies has played a key role in the
Arab Spring democracy movements. That's not to say Twitter caused the revolution. Absent the underlying problems of injustice I doubt
we'd be where we are today. There's also a dark side to this technology, because repressive regimes will be just as sophisticated in using
these tools and technologies to suppress communication and expression.

NJ: In what other ways have these technologies impacted U.S. public diplomacy?

McHale: With the proliferation of information technology across all societies, people around the world are participating in shaping the
political lives of their countries to an unprecedented degree. That drove us to an understanding that the United States government had
to take a different approach to public diplomacy. For centuries, traditional diplomacy was conducted on a government-to-government
basis through negotiations. That continues to be a critical component of diplomacy. We need to complement it, however, with a new

outreach to populations that are increasingly involved in their governments' decisions. If we don't strengthen those relationships then
we can't meet our foreign policy objectives or, frankly, assure our own security. That meant we needed to find ways to engage 7 billion
people around the world. It's hard to shake all of their hands, so we had to look for new ways to engage them.

NJ: How do you shape a consistent narrative when addressing so many different audiences?

McHale: Shaping a narrative in today's world means understanding that the media landscape has changed dramatically. People talk of a
 'technological revolution,' but it's no20 years old, so this new world is here to stay, and it requires us to react to events very quickly.
We've had to move beyond just pushing out press releases, for instance, to engaging proactively and broadly across both traditional and
social media. If we don't respond quickly to an inaccurate story, for instance, we will never get beyond it, because they live forever on
the internet. I have a 16-person Center for Strategic Counter-Terrorism Communications, for example, that rapidly responds to any
message from al-Qaida that we see online, and is willing to explain and debate the American position on violent extremism.

The larger point is that in the world of social media, if you don't provide a context for what you're doing, other people will interpret your
actions for you. That's why this morning I met with 3o plus bloggers from around the world, who have an expectation that I will engage
with them in dialogue. I have 200 folks at the State Department focused solely on social media, and around i,000 employees worldwide
who have social media as a large component of their jobs. We produce ioo foreign language Twitter feeds. That's the character of 21st
century diplomacy.

NJ: So is improving America's image and countering widespread anti-Americanism just a matter of better messaging
and adept use of social media?

McHale: No, it can't just be about messaging. If we're sitting here in Washington, D.C., and trying to figure out what foreign policy will
or will not work in Tunisia, for instance, no amount of messaging is going to help. Messaging divorced from informed policymaking will
fail.

NJ: Despite all of your hard work, how do you explain polls that show the U.S. is still profoundly unpopular in many
parts of the world?

McHale: While I would push back against the idea that we are unpopular everywhere, certainly we operate in a very challenging
environment. Some of the unpopularity goes with being such a large, powerful nation. Sometimes it results from policies that we pursue
in our national interests that are disliked abroad. Other times it results from ignorance or misconceptions. Even in especially
 challenging areas like the Middle East, however, we find there are areas where people are eager to work with the United States, such as

science, education, and entrepreneurship. So we can't be so focused on poll numbers that we lose sight of areas of potential cooperation.

Subject: Iran says US plot suspect is anti-Tehran militant (Reuters)
</span>
TEHRAN, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Iran has complained to the United Nations about a U.S. accusation it tried to
assassinate a Saudi diplomat, saying one of the alleged plotters Washington calls an Iranian military official is
really a member of an anti-Tehran rebel group.

    Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said on Saturday the plot was part of a multi-pronged U.S. strategy to
smear Tehran, a process he said would continue next week when the U.N. nuclear agency publishes a report
western diplomats say will contain new evidence about Iran's nuclear programme.

    The complaint to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon turned the U.S. accusation that Tehran supports
terrorism back onto Washington, Salehi said.

    "This letter contains our complaint about the plots of the United States, reliable information that we have of

the U.S. involvement in those plots," he said in a news conference broadcast live on the English language
channel Press TV.

    On its website, Press TV reported the letter said a suspect who U.S. prosecutors have identified as an Iranian

military official is actually a member of the exiled Iranian rebel group Mujahideen Khalq Organisation
(MKO).

    One of two men charged with plotting to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington, 56-year-old Iranian-
American Manssor Arbabsiar, pleaded not guilty at a court hearing in New York last month.

    The second, Gholam Shakuri, is still at large and U.S. officials say he is a member of the Quds Force, an arm
 of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, who approved the plan to hire Mexican gangsters to murder Saudi Ambassador
 Adel al-Jubeir.

    The semi-official Mehr news agency reported on Oct. 17 that Shakuri was a member of the MKO, also
 known as the People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran (PMOI), based in Iraq and listed as a terrorist group by
 the United States.

    Citing "informed sources", Mehr said Shakuri had travelled to Washington and to the MKO base at Camp
 Ashraf in Iraq.

    Iranian officials did not initially comment on the report which said Interpol had discovered Shakuri's true

 identity, but Press TV reported on Saturday it  was now in the letter delivered to Ban.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05783101 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

   "LET THEM PUBLISH"

   Washington is using what it says was a foiled plot to help bolster international support to tighten sanctions
on Iran which it accuses of developing nuclear weapons and sponsoring terrorism, charges denied by Tehran.

   Israeli and western media have increased speculation in recent days that Israel might launch a strike on Iran's

nuclear sites. Some analysts say that, rather than any firm evidence military action is imminent, the chatter
reflects efforts to increase diplomatic pressure on Tehran.

   Salehi said Iran did not fear possible revelations in a report to be issued by the International Atomic Energy

Agency (IAEA) on Wednesday that western diplomats say will make a "compelling case" the Iranian nuclear
programme is not entirely peaceful.

   "They are claiming that they are going to publish new documents. We know what the truth is -- let them

publish them and we'll see what happens. Will they not be called into question as an agency that is under
pressure by foreign powers?" Salehi said.

   The IAEA report, the assassination plot and accusations about human rights abuses were a "three-pronged
attack from the West against Iran ... just an assault to pressure Iran into subjugation," he said.

   Salehi repeated the stance of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who has said Iran has 100
"undeniable documents" proving U.S. involvement in terrorism.

</span>

Don't worry, I didn't forget!

Some further background. Exploring whether there is any way to move Turkey or China on this.

The 1997 UN Convention on Transnational Rivers codifies an international water law for shared rivers, stating
that rivers must be used by their States in an equitable manner, and in particular, that an upstream state should
not take action on a waterway that substantially harms or changes the downstream portion.

The Convention was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1997 in a vote with 103 countries for it, 3 against
(Burundi, China, and Turkey) and 27 abstentions. To enter force, the document required ratification by 35
countries, but was only ratified by 16. The United States did not ratify the Convention. We have stated that

while the Convention is an excellent guideline for parties attempting to work out disputes over shared waters,
each transboundary water problem is unique and should be addressed on a case-by-case basis, and the United
States already addressed these issues by establishing our own international water agreements with Mexico and
Canada. While China and Turkey have not publicly stated why they did not vote for the Convention, both

countries  are the sources of several major transboundary rivers, and losing upstream control of them has major
economic and security-related implications.

China has refused to sign onto any international agreements that obligate the upstream nation to guarantee water

to downstream neighbors. As the source of some of the largest transnational river systems in the world—
including the Mekong, Indus, and Brahmaputra, China has much to lose from signing onto such agreements,
especially in light of the country's plans to drastically increase hydropower generation through damming. China

has 200 GW of hydropower capacity (a fifth of its total power generating capacity) and seeks to reach 430 GW
by 2020. In order to meet this goal, not only are they planning to move forward with projects in controversial
areas such as Tibet and Yunnan, they are also building dams in several South East Asian countries that the
Mekong passes through in order to export the power generated back to China. Some analysts suggest that the

Chinese may use their control over water supplies as a political tool.

In the case of Turkey, 99 percent of the country's transboundary waters are the Tigris and Euphrates, and
Turkey is the source of both rivers. Hydropower and increased irrigation on farms is a key component of

Turkey's strategy to develop Anatolia in the Southeastern region of the country, and maintaining upstream
control of the Tigris and Euphrates is critical to that effort. Additionally, Turkey already has flow-rate
agreements with Iraq and Syria and would argue that, because it has negotiated the amount of water it will allow
to flow downstream, it has already met its obligation to allow other countries fair access to its transboundary

waters.

By Associated Press, Published: November 28

CARACOL, Haiti —.The biggest international project aimed at helping Haiti rebound from the              2010
earthquake eased closer to reality at a ceremony Monday.

Former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Haitian President Michel Martelly broke ground for an

ambitious $224 million industrial park in northern Haiti that they hope will generate tens of
thousands of jobs, house 5,000 of the workers and educate 500 of their children in a new school

Those involved hope the South Korean garment manufacturer Sae-A Trading Co. Ltd. will set an example

and urge other foreign businesses to invest in Haiti, a country long ignored by outsiders because of its
cumbersome laws, heaps of red tape and occasional political tumult.

"Investors still do not believe or understand the value and potential of Haiti as we do," Kim Woong-ki,

 chairman of Sae-A, said through an interpreter in the northern town of Caracol. "Let's open this closed
 door and mind set toward Haiti and highlight the true value and potential of Haiti."

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05785139 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

The project on the 617-acre (250-hectare) site was in the works long before the January   2010 earthquake
but became a priority after Clinton was named the United Nations' special envoy for Haiti in 2009 and

given responsibility for spurring private investment.

On the eve of the quake's first anniversary, the Haitian government and Sae-A signed an agreement to
create the industrial park, which will export clothing to the United States. Among the company's   20

existing factories are plants in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Indonesia and Vietnam.

The United States has provided $120 million for generating electricity, housing for workers and
improvements to a port in the north. The Inter-American Development Bank will provide $50 million for

building factory shells and infrastructure.

The Caracol industrial park is intended to be Haiti's largest private employer, with a goal of providing
20,000  jobs at the park and creating 133,000 in all through cottage industries

The first T-shirts are scheduled be made in May or June of next year.

"This is the kind of change we need," Martelly said from a stage surrounded by bulldozers and other

heavy machinery. "This is the kind of development we need."

Workers will be paid Haiti's minimum wage, which is $5 a day, and will be eligible for bonuses based on
performance.

Clinton said the industrial park will eventually improve the lives of about 500,000 people as the complex

brings in other tenants and small businesses emerge around the plant.

Thirty percent of Sae-A's jobs will be set aside for women.

Nella Felix hopes to be among them. She's a sometime street vendor who makes up the 6o percent of the
population that makes about $2 a day.

"For me, it's a real way for the youth of the community to live, to find jobs and work," Felix, 42, said after

the ceremony. "I'm waiting to see what they can do for us."

Critics of the industrial park argue that Haiti would be better off investing money in its long-neglected
agriculture sector instead of the garment sector, which has stumbled along because of sporadic political

upheaval.

Reginald Boulos, a business leader and former senator for the region, acknowledged the shortcomings
but said the thousands of jobs will stimulate the area's economy, allowing parents to send their children

to school.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05785139 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

"I don't think an industrial plant is the best way to create jobs," Boulos said before the ceremony started.
"But it's a beginning. It's a first step to being self-sufficient."

Separately, Clinton and Martelly announced Monday that the Digicel phone company will help build a

$45 million, 173-room hotel with Marriott International. The new franchise is expected to create 175
jobs.

Construction is expected to begin next year in Turgeau, one of the few middle-class neighborhoods in

Port-au-Prince proper. Opening is scheduled for mid-2014.

        Serial No. 11-1383

        Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton
        Secretary of State of the United States

        Washington, DC

        Dear Secretary Clinton:

        During the course of the Fifteenth Anniversary joint Review of the Compact of Free Association
        between the United States and Palau, I had to convey disappointment at times with positions
        taken by some Department of State personnel. I am writing today, however, to compliment the
        letter that Acting Assistant Secretary Rodriguez sent Chairman Bingaman of the U.S. Senate

        Committee on Energy and Natural Resources April   5tregarding the Senate bill to implement the
        Agreement produced by the Review and also to compliment the efforts that Deputy Assistant
        Secretary Reed has made regarding the Agreement.

        The letter and efforts have displayed deep understanding of the relationship between our freely
        associated states and the mutual benefits flowing from this special association as well as what is
        needed to approve the Agreement and continue the association.

        Let me also take this opportunity to express great appreciation for the instrumental actions that
        you and members of your staff took to resolve Review issues, for work done by then Deputy
        Secretary Lew, and for the involvement of Assistant Secretary Campbell. This attention was
        absolutely critical to obtaining agreement. I took very seriously the advice given through Jeff
        Farrow last summer that the Review should be concluded so that an agreement could be approved
        last year and am grateful for the opportunity that we then had to finally negotiate the issues as
        well as for Secretary Reed being the negotiator.

        Although the Agreement ultimately was sent to the U.S. Congress this year, I am confident that
        continued perceptive efforts, such as those by Secretaries Reed and Rodriguez, will result in a
        continuation of the free association between our nations.

        Sincerely yours,

          hnson Toribiong
        President
        Republic of Palau

Subject:  Convention on Transnational Rivers
</span>

Don't worry, I didn't forget!

Some further background. Exploring whether there is any way to move Turkey or China on this.

The 1997 UN Convention on Transnational Rivers codifies an international water law for shared rivers, stating
that rivers must be used by their States in an equitable manner, and in particular, that an upstream state should
not take action on a waterway that substantially harms or changes the downstream portion.

The Convention    was adopted by the UN General Assembly in      1997 in a vote with 103 countries for it, 3 against
(Burundi, China, and Turkey) and 27 abstentions. To enter force, the document required ratification by 35
countries, but was only ratified by 16. The United States did  not ratify the Convention. We have stated that

while the Convention is an excellent guideline for parties attempting to work out disputes over shared waters,
each transboundary water problem is unique and should be addressed on a case-by-case basis, and the United
States already addressed these issues by establishing our own international water agreements with Mexico and

Canada. While China and Turkey have not publicly stated why they did not vote for the Convention, both
countries are the sources of several major transboundary rivers, and losing upstream control of them has major
economic and security-related implications.

China has refused to sign onto any international agreements that obligate the upstream nation to guarantee water
to downstream neighbors. As the source of some of the largest transnational river systems in the world—
including the Mekong, Indus, and Brahmaputra, China has much to lose from signing onto such agreements,

especially in light of the country's plans to drastically increase hydropower generation through damming. China
has 200 GW of hydropower capacity (a fifth of its total power generating capacity) and seeks to reach 430 GW
by 2020. In order to meet this goal, not only are they planning to move forward with projects in controversial

areas such as Tibet and Yunnan, they are also building dams in several South East Asian countries that the
Mekong passes through in order to export the power generated back to China. Some analysts suggest that the
Chinese may use their control over water supplies as a political tool.

In the case of Turkey, 99 percent of the country's transboundary waters are the Tigris and Euphrates, and
Turkey is the source of both rivers. Hydropower and increased irrigation on farms is a key component of
Turkey's strategy to develop Anatolia in the Southeastern region of the country, and maintaining upstream

control of the Tigris and Euphrates is critical to that effort. Additionally, Turkey already has flow-rate
agreements with Iraq and Syria and would argue that, because it has negotiated the amount of water it will allow
to flow downstream, it has already met its obligation to allow other countries fair access to its transboundary

waters.

Tom, she moved that yellow chair as close as it went. Knee to knee. Amazed she didn't try knee in between knee. And if
that wasn't enough, she leaned forward. More like a pivot, as far as her torso could fold forward to minimize the space

between their heads. Was like the dental hygienist rolling around the floor to get the best access to your mouth
depending on what tooth she was trying to get access to. I've never seen a Westerner invade her space like that. And
even the non-Westerners I've seen do it based on cultural differences have been only briefly to greet. This went on like

that for 51 minutes - unacceptable in any culture. I don't even think you see that behavior among any type of mammal.

The touching the leg and repeatedly calling her 'Hillary' was just gravy.

But it was wonderful. One of the best interviews I've ever witnessed. Wish it were on live tv.

This will be exciting when it's FOIA'd ...but will give you a sense of the interaction:

 HRC:  Monica, have a seat
::HRC motions toward a chair situated an appropriate distance from her preferred spot on the couch::

 Monica: !!!!SurellIll

::Monica proceeds to drag her chair within inches of the Secretary —leaning in even further::

 Interview proceeds.. .and about midway:

 Monica:  Oh Hillary. .2016 '16 '16
   Monica grabs HRC's knee::

 HRC laughs awkwardly — glances at Philippe

 Monica:  ::leaning in further::
 Oh Hillary...what do you eat? drink? dream about when you sleep?

:: Monica again touches HRC's leg::

::Everybody laughs awkwardly — Philippe hardly able to contain himself::

Monica: They think I'm so funny (looking at Philippe and me.) HILL, can I ride on your lap to the White House?

  this went for about 51 minutes. And I agree with Philippe- whatever she does, it works. It was a really great interview.

Tom, was an awesome interview. Hrc was great, but I was really impressed by how good of an interviewer Monica is.
One of the best I've ever seen. But she was her usual wacky self and pulled one move that I can't even describe so I'll let

Caroline do - since you'll appreciate it given your familiarity with Monica Langley, Hillary Clinton, and the Secretary's

Enjoy!
Caroline

                                    UNEDITED - FOR INTERNAL USE

                Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Monica Langley of The Wall Street Journal

                                               October 10, 2012

                                              Department of State

 QUESTION:   Oh, so you've had a fun morning.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:      It's been a busy morning.

 QUESTION:   Yeah, yeah.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:      Yeah.

 QUESTION:   So what did you do besides Desmond Tutu? I saw that one — (laughter) — but I know there's been much more.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:      Well, we did a lot of internal meetings which are kind of in preparation for everything to come the last

 three months. So talking about all of the issues. I had everybody do a

 QUESTION:   I'm moving closer.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:      Sure. (Laughter.) Had everybody do memos about what they wanted to get done and what they needed
 from me to get done, so we've been kind of going through all of that, and --

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

QUESTION:    To get done before you actually leave (inaudible)?

SECRETARY CLINTON:      Before I actually leave. And also to set up for some post-election memos for the President about not
only what we do here at State and

QUESTION:    Are we recording this for sure? You know it's working? Okay.

PARTICIPANT:    For sure, yes.

SECRETARY CLINTON: --     USAID, but also for how it interacts with the rest of government, DOD, USTR, Commerce, HHS, you
name it. So there's a lot of that work going on. Obviously, we're working hard to be responsive to the Congress in their requests on
our terrible tragedy in Benghazi, and give them information, and try to run an effective, accurate, investigation so we can get to the

bottom of what happened. And then I did have this long, funny meeting with Desmond Tutu and about 10 other people about the
International Day of the Girl, first ever.

QUESTION:    I thought that was great.

                         Isn't that terrific?
SECRETARY CLINTON:

QUESTION:    As a mother of an only daughter

SECRETARY CLINTON:       Me too, me too.

QUESTION:    Like you, exactly.

SECRETARY CLINTON:       And I --

QUESTION:    And Barbara was one of my daughter and Langley Grace's (ph) teachers.

SECRETARY CLINTON:       You're kidding.

QUESTION:    Yeah, who is Chelsea's

 SECRETARY CLINTON:      Yeah, yeah.

 QUESTION: --  best friend's mother.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:      Nicole --

 QUESTION:   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SECRETARY CLINTON: --     is Chelsea's, yes, best friend.

             Yeah, so I found out about that long ago.
 QUESTION:

 SECRETARY CLINTON:      Oh, she's a wonderful teacher.

 QUESTION:   Yes, she is. She's one of my daughter's favorite.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:      The whole family is fabulous. In fact, Nicole and Chelsea have remained such good friends, they live in

 the same building in New York, and they're just great friends.

 QUESTION:   Oh gosh, isn't that great?

 SECRETARY CLINTON:      Yeah.

 QUESTION:    Okay. So let me tell you about this story. It started as a personality profile of you.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:      Okay.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

QUESTION: Ordered at the highest level of The Wall Street Journal(laughter) — believe it or not. And I do page one profiles, but
this came down as like, "You are the star of the Obama Administration."

SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, my goodness.

QUESTION: So I said, "Okay, fine." I had fun covering you in your campaigns.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, yeah.

QUESTION: And so I would love to do it even though I know very little about foreign policy and State — (laughter). I thought,
okay, this will be good for—this will be a good personality profile. Well, it morphed into — now it's become the action profile.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Okay.

QUESTION: Because your life —

SECRETARY CLINTON: -- is just constant action.

QUESTION: Totally. I mean, you just about killed me over the last (inaudible) — (laughter). I've got nothing. I've got nothing
except gained five pounds. Anyway, I don't know how you do it. So — and then I thought, for a graphic for this story, all we need to
do is show the countries you visited, we can put that in one color on a map of the globe.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, yeah.

QUESTION: And then if we colored in every country you've talked to or person you've touched, you've been all over the — you've
talked to like almost every country.

SECRETARY CLINTON: I think that's probably right.

QUESTION: In the last five weeks.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes.

QUESTION: I mean, it's been unbelievable.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, it's been pretty jam-packed.

QUESTION: It is.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Starting with August, coming all the way to mid-October.

QUESTION: Exactly. So I thought this story was going to be kind of your easy g-out. It's turned out to be m—ch

SECRETARY CLINTON: I don't think there is such a thing. I think in today's world, there is nothing easy or potentially gliding for

this job. There is just too much going on, and you know everything that's going on because we are hyper-connected. So there's no
doubt in my mind I will work to the last minute before I leave the building.

QUESTION: Has this, though — since I'm focused on this last 4-5 week period — has it been your most challenging part of your
tenure, or not?

SECRETARY CLINTON: It's been among the most challenging. There's no doubt about that. And it's been challenging on many

levels. Of course, the terrible events in Benghazi, but also in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa that didn't get as much
attention because, thankfully, no one was killed or injured. But we've had to keep a close watch on a lot of different places. We've
spent — I've spent time, as you know, in the Far East, in China and Vladivostok, and working on trying to manage what are always
complicated relationships, but made more so because of changes in leadership and challenges like who owns what rock where.

QUESTION: Yeah, yeah.

SECRETARY CLINTON: And working hard with the ASEAN nations to support their efforts for peaceful resolution of their
disputes. UNGA is always exhausting. It is a non-stop dawn-to-midnight marathon.

QUESTION: Can I back you up to —

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

SECRETARY CLINTON:       Sure.

QUESTION:    Because I've joined you in Jakarta and Beijing.

SECRETARY CLINTON:        Right.

QUESTION: That's all I could handle of your trip. (Laughter.) So in Jakarta, I watched you talk to the embassy folks there and

noticed one person said to you, "I can't wait to vote for you in four years."

SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh.

QUESTION: You said, "Bless your heart," or something like that. (Laughter.) Okay, so — but I want to try to get — I want to put —
string together these anecdotes.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Okay.

QUESTION: So I want to get your perspective on some of the things I saw. Now, in Beijing, a similar thing came up. I heard, at the
dinner — that dinner 'til 1 a.m. So — did the Foreign Minister say to you — somebody told me he said to you, "You will be so young
when you are President." Do you remember his saying that?

SECRETARY CLINTON:        Well, it wasn't the Foreign Minister.

QUESTION:    Oh, who said it?

SECRETARY CLINTON:        It was the State Counselor

QUESTION: Okay.

SECRETARY CLINTON: --       Dai Bingguo, who has become a very good partner for me as I've worked with China. He was my
counterpart in the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, and he was kidding me because he's retiring.

QUESTION:    Are you sure he was kidding you?

SECRETARY CLINTON:        Well, I think so. That's my interpretation. He's retiring and he's probably at least ten years older than I
am. And he's saying to me, "Why are you retiring? You're so young!" I said, "Boy, I'd travel a thousand miles to anywhere to be
told I was so young." (Laughter.)

QUESTION:    Okay.

SECRETARY CLINTON: But       it was more along the lines of, he will be leaving with the change in leadership in China, and I will
be voluntarily leaving, as I announced a year ago.

QUESTION:    Yeah, yeah, yeah, more on that later.

Okay, so then, the next day, you have Xi cancel on you.

SECRETARY CLINTON:        Yeah. I'm not--

QUESTION:    Now, he cancelled on others, too.

SECRETARY CLINTON:        Right.

 QUESTION: But you were told — were you told it was the back injury?

 SECRETARY CLINTON:       Yeah. But that — we were told the night before, and I took it at face value, really, because from our
 perspective, I had a very good set of discussions with him both here in Washington and in my previous trip to Beijing. And as you
 know, he was unable to keep his schedule for ten days.

 QUESTION:    Right, he'd not been seen in public, exactly.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:       Yeah, so I didn't really think anything other than what I was told.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

QUESTION: Did it frustrate you, though? 'Cause you were all the way over there, and --

SECRETARY CLINTON: No, because I had so many other meetings.

QUESTION: Okay. Okay, okay.

SECRETARY CLINTON: I mean, I didn't go specifically to see him. I went to continue our dialogue.

QUESTION: Did they get a little ticked off that we reported that it was a back injury, since they like to keep things so close to the
vest?

SECRETARY CLINTON: I don't — I don't know that.

QUESTION: Okay. And then at your press conference, I sat in the front row right in front of you because I was a pool reporter.

PARTICIPANT: Just like this. (Laughter.)

QUESTION: Yes, you know me. I like to be very touchy-feely. If I could've touched you, I would.

Anyway, so I sat there, and you as a politician came through to me loud and clear. You took control of that press conference, okay. I
mean, you said your little pleasantries, he said his pleasantries, and then you took charge. And it wasn't just about the South China
Seas. You hit all the things, Syria, Iran, not — and all the others. North Korea.

So then he was on his heels. And he's like — he was wanting to get in. So tell me: What was your thinking? Was it purposeful? Was

that your strategy going in? I'd like to — I want to describe that, because to me, you clearly had the political savvy over your
counterpart.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, we have very different systems. He's an incredibly accomplished diplomat, and as you rightly
point out, we both made our points. And I --

QUESTION: He did make his points, but only after he was on his heels.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, that's your interpretation.

QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SECRETARY CLINTON: I had a very clear understanding of what I needed to say because there were all these issues that we were

talking about. And they are complicated, challenging issues. So I wanted to be sure that I put it out there, and I didn't want to say
anything other than what my assessment was at the time. Some people say, "Well, you're in a foreign country, you shouldn't do this,"
or whatever.

QUESTION: Yeah, exactly.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Now, I mean, I think we're living in a world where everybody knows what you say everywhere.

QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SECRETARY CLINTON: And I believe you have to say the same thing, you have to be consistent, repetitive, make the case
knowing full well that there's a resistance on the part of China and Russia to be more constructive in the Security Council. But insofar
 as I could break through in their mass media as well as the international mass media, I was going to make that effort.

 QUESTION: Which goes to this point which I was going to get to a little bit later about — one way you've tried to change, I think,
 the Secretary of State — you've changed the terms of what it means, is this public diplomacy. You are knowing you're reaching a
 different audience. You're not just playing right there at that press conference.

 SECRETARY CLINTON: Right. A hundred percent right, Monica. I mean, I believe I am the chief public diplomat of the State
 Department, and as well as the chief diplomat. But there's the public role to it, which is increasingly important, because you can't just

 go somewhere, have your meeting behind closed doors, do a controlled readout, and go on to the next capital. Because in every
 society now, you have to recognize there is a public audience as well as an official audience.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

So I am conscious of that from the very first trip I made in early February 2009. I've been trying to talk about America's values and

our interests and our security everywhere I can.

QUESTION: Is that in part — did you have a vision that you also have to remake America's brand?

SECRETARY CLINTON: I think we — I think our brand was battered for a lot of reasons. We came into office in the midst of the
economic crisis, which was very dangerous, and I thought that — and still do — that confidence is a commodity, and we had to show
confidence. We had to be making smart decisions. We had to reassure leaders and markets and people, and that was part of my job

on that first trip that I made and every trip since.

I was in Hong Kong when the debate over the debt was going on, and I had all of these very wealthy, distinguished, high-ranking
people from Hong Kong lining up to say, "What's going to happen in America? What are they doing over there?" And I said, "Oh,
don't worry about it. We will get to a decision." Because I had to be, at that moment, displaying the kind of confidence that our

country has, and our ability to make decisions, even hard decisions, in order to keep leading the world economically and politically,
and I believe that.

QUESTION: Okay. Let me then jump — you came — well, of course, there's the campaign. On September 6   th, you watch your
husband at the convention.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.

QUESTION: Okay. What did you feel at that moment?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, I was thrilled. It was so odd for me not to be there. I've been at every convention for decades, and
there I was in East —

QUESTION: Did you miss it?

SECRETARY CLINTON: in Timor-Leste.

QUESTION: Yeah. Yeah.

SECRETARY CLINTON: I missed a lot of what goes with conventions — seeing people from all over the country, having that sense
 of purpose that a convention is supposed to give you to go out in the election and work your heart out for your candidate. But on the
 other hand, I also believed and knew that what I was doing was very important for my country. So I certainly didn't miss —

 QUESTION: And did you hear you were a big topic of conversation there about whether Hillary —

 SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, well —

 QUESTION: 2016?

 SECRETARY CLINTON: That seems to be a topic of conversation for a lot of people, which is —

 QUESTION: Everywhere, okay.

 SECRETARY CLINTON: -- which is fine.

 QUESTION: Okay.

 SECRETARY CLINTON: But it was thanks to the hard work of Philippe and others that we were able to see in nearly real time. I
 mean, we had to wait till it was recorded, because I had a schedule that I had to keep, but then we were able to watch the whole

 speech. It was great.

 QUESTION: Yeah. Okay. Now, you came back home September 1 l       th. So let's talk about how you faced that day, just a couple key
 moments, because I don't want to relive the whole thing.

 SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.

 QUESTION: But what were the key moments to you? Was it when you first were told the Ambassador's missing? Was it when you
 found out he was actually — they had found him?

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

SECRETARY CLINTON:         No. It predated that, because I take September 11th very seriously. I was a senator from New York on
             t.
September 11

QUESTION:     Right. And I lived in New York on September 1 lth at the time.

SECRETARY CLINTON: And          it was a searing, painful experience in every way, and so every September Ilth I'm on hyper alert
for what's going on around the world. And we always have discussions in our security — among our security experts — okay,
September Ilth is coming up. Because we pick up intelligence, we pick up chatter that people might want to do something somewhere

in the world. So everybody is watching. That's — but we had a very strong set of standards that we've tried to follow around the
world.

And then simultaneously, we had this video coming out, which we were getting lots of feedback from our posts that this was a
problem, that people were reacting to it. So there was a lot swirling around. And clearly, when we started hearing about what was
happening in Cairo, what was happening in Tunisia, what was happening in Benghazi and other places — because there were

demonstrations going on in many places, and they were being, to some extent, hijacked by extremists with other agendas.

But then when we were alerted to what was going on in Benghazi, we were all just totally focused on trying to find out what we could
under quite difficult circumstances, and we're still trying to get to the bottom of what happened when. But that day, it was all
consuming. We were all just as active as we could given the distance, trying to manage everything that was happening, and be
responsive in real time. And of course, it was primarily the duty of the security experts who have those responsibilities, but I was here

and others were here trying to sort through all the information as it was coming in.

QUESTION:     Do you — today the front page of thest says this is now going to mar your — what had been your great record at
State. I mean, are you ultimately, Hillary, going to have to take responsibility for this?

                            Oh, I take responsibility. That's not even — that's not a question. I take responsibility. I'm the
SECRETARY CLINTON:
Secretary of State. I have 60,000-plus employees around the world, and this is like a big family. I mean, these Foreign Service and
Civil Service officers, many of whom have worked with each other, they know each other, I have — I'm working with people today
that I first met when I was First Lady, and they were a young diplomat somewhere that I showed up. I sent Chris Stevens to Benghazi
 in the height of the Libyan conflict.

 QUESTION:     Yeah, yeah.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:         And he was eager to go, and he was very effective, and then I recommended him to be our ambassador,
 and I had the highest regard for him.

 QUESTION:     Gosh, that must make it that much

 SECRETARY CLINTON:         Oh, it's painful, Monica. It's absolutely painful, because it's not just a faceless person.

 QUESTION:     Yeah, exactly.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:         It's people who, if! didn't know them personally, somebody close to me in this building knew them, had
 worked with them, was at the same post five or ten years ago. So there's an extraordinary sense of loss and responsibility. Every one
 of us who had any responsibility, from the security experts on up, we all feel like we have to figure out what happened, because we

 clearly want to make sure it doesn't happen again. But there is an inherent risk in this job.

 When I okayed sending Robert Ford to Hama at the beginning of the Syrian conflict, that was a risk. We said, "Robert, do you want
 to go there? It's dangerous. We can't guarantee your safety, because we have to rely on host nations."

 QUESTION:     Yeah, yeah.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:         But you think it's the right thing to do. It clearly sends a message about where the United States' values
 are.

 Or when I was in Egypt, and we were protested against in Cairo, and then the security people came to me and said, "You're supposed
 to go to Alexandria. It's a much less fortified position than we have in Cairo. Maybe you shouldn't go." I said, "No." I said, "I'm
 going to go." I went. But, I mean, we had people throwing shoes and tomatoes.

 This is an inherently risky world. It is a dangerous world. And we will do our very best, as our military and intelligence colleagues
 do, to try to think through how to provide as much security as possible, but you can't keep people behind 20-foot walls and expect

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

them to do their jobs. And whether it's the Marine barracks in Beirut being blown up or a CIA outpost in Afghanistan, Americans
need to realize that it's not only our soldiers; it's our civilians serving our country who are also putting their lives on the line to —

QUESTION: Well, that's been the wakeup call of this incident.

SECRETARY CLINTON: -- to do the job that we ask them to do.

QUESTION: So one thing that a lot of people have said in this is another — somebody from the White House told me they thought
watching you and Obama at the Andrews Air Force Base, there was a new bond between you two, that everybody knows you all
aren't buddy-buddy, but you all clearly respect each other and work together. Do you feel that you had a new bond? I mean, I saw
that you touched his hand — on watching the — watching it, you touched his hand after he spoke, and then when you all walked back to
the families that he put his arm around your waist. Do you feel this gave some — did you feel that at that moment? Somebody at the

White House saw it, and then somebody at the State Department also thought so.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I feel like there have been a number of moments — maybe not public moments —that have been
very, very precious to me in my relationship with the President. I was in that very small group that made the decision about bin Ladin
and was there in that Sit Room, and --

QUESTION: Right, which we've all seen that picture.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, going up and down the emotional rollercoaster. And walked with him across the Colonnade in the
White House for him to address the nation. I mean, there are a lot of moments, but that was a particularly poignant time for both of us
because we live every day — he as President, I as Secretary — with the knowledge that decisions we make, sending a Chris Stevens to
Libya, are ones that have risk and danger attached to them. And so I --

QUESTION: When he came here that --

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes.

QUESTION: -- next day, did you call him and say, "I'd love you to come over?"

SECRETARY CLINTON: I did. I did.

QUESTION: Do you call him, like, on the secure phone?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, yes.

QUESTION: Where's the secure phone?

SECRETARY CLINTON: In my office.

QUESTION: Oh.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, yeah, we have a secure phone. Yeah.

QUESTION: I know. Did you call him on the secure phone?

SECRETARY CLINTON: We wanted --

QUESTION: Or do you only do that if there's, like, a real emergency?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. We communicate in lots of different ways. But I thought it was important if he could, but it was
— I knew that he has a lot of other demands on his time, and I was going over to the Rose Garden and then I said, "Mr. President, can —
 do you have time to come by and see our people if we can get them gathered?" And he didn't hesitate, absolutely. And it was --

 QUESTION: Do you say Mr. President or do you say Barack?

 SECRETARY CLINTON: I do. I say Mr. President. I believe strongly in saying Mr. President.

 QUESTION: Okay.

 SECRETARY CLINTON: I think it's a sign of respect for the person and for the office.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

QUESTION: Okay.

SECRETARY CLINTON: I mean, I called him Barack when I was a senator with him, but --

QUESTION: Yeah, yeah.

SECRETARY CLINTON: -- now he's the President and I respect that.

QUESTION: Okay. Now let's start going toward UNGA. The — on September 15t     h, I think the Saturday before Netanyahu was
going to be on Meet The Press, you had a private call with him.

SECRETARY CLINTON: I did, I did.

QUESTION: Okay. And that — the Mideast thing and Iran, it's kind of been in tumult. So the relationship — do you feel that you
need to work your — work on that with your past relationship with him? I mean, this is — as two politicians to one another, what's —
show me how this works.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, look. I've known Bibi a long time, and I consider him a friend. He is somebody who I've spent a
lot of time talking to in New York, in Washington, in Jerusalem. We have had long in-person conversations, long telephone

conversations. And I respect the fact that he is trying to protect Israel, that — I often tell people, put yourself into the position of the
Prime Minister of Israel at a time of great tumult and uncertainty. And so I guess I would say, on a pretty regular basis, we — I check
in with him.

QUESTION: Does that help, though, given that, kind of, people view his relationship with the President as rocky, that you all --

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well --

QUESTION: -- are in kind of— have your own relationship?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, here's — I think he's been around so long he has good relationships with a lot of people, and I think
 he has a relationship of mutual respect with the President. And his concerns about what's going to happen are totally
 legitimate. They're concerns that the President shares, which is why the President has said our policy is prevention, not

 containment. And he's been very, very clear about that.

 QUESTION: Okay. Now then you go to New York for UNGA. But I talked to Betsy, your friend from Park Ridge.

 SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right.

 QUESTION: Okay. So she brought this up on her own about your hair.

 SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.)        •

 QUESTION: She said --

 STAFF: I'm amazed you got — what --

 QUESTION: (Laughter.) The pizza party --

 SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, right.

 QUESTION: At the pizza party --

 SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right.

 QUESTION: -- she said to you she likes your hair long, and she said it suits where you are in your life right now. Do you remember
 her saying this to you?

 SECRETARY CLINTON: Honestly, I don't, but --

 QUESTION: Okay. I don't even bring this up.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

SECRETARY CLINTON: No, I don't. I mean --

QUESTION: You hear about this all the --

STAFF: I can't believe you're using poor Betsy as a device.

QUESTION: I know. This is great.

SECRETARY CLINTON: I would be happy to talk to you sometime about all of— all that, all that stuff.

QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, but not that. But she said that. Okay. All right.

SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.)

QUESTION: So anyway, so you have the pizza party, then — and your husband and your daughter are there.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.

QUESTION: At least that was a nice break.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right.

QUESTION: Okay. Then you go into full-scale work.

SECRETARY CLINTON: UNGA, UNGA, UNGA.

QUESTION: Okay. But you first appeared at the Clinton Global Initiative, which was a key --

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, no. I started working on Sunday.

QUESTION: Oh, okay, okay.

SECRETARY CLINTON: I was at the Clinton Global Initiative Monday morning, but I started having what we call bilats on
Sunday.

QUESTION: Okay. Yeah. And I wrote down you did — it looks like you had 29 bilats, you had 54 meetings or events that
week. And I don't know if you noticed, but I was running in as a little pool reporter just to see any glimpse of you.

SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.)

QUESTION: And I would try to hang to hear what they were saying. The Yemen President said you work nonstop, you're shuttling

around the world, you're on TV every day.

SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.) Yeah.

QUESTION: I mean, your public image is really fascinating --

SECRETARY CLINTON: For people all over the world.

QUESTION: -- to all these foreign leaders.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, I know.

QUESTION: I mean, they really, like, admire that.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well --

QUESTION: Don't you think — what does that tell you?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, look. I think in today's world, America has to show up. We have to show up in a lot of places to
make the casefor what we believe are the right choices for us and for partners and the world. So I'm constantly being told by leaders,
presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers, "I'm exhausted watching you."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

QUESTION: Exactly. I once heard — they'll say that.

SECRETARY CLINTON:        They're the very same people who get quunhappy if I don't show up.

QUESTION: Exactly.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Like, "Oh, can you come to this?" "Gee, I'm so sorry I can't." "Okay, I'll change the date. When can
you come?" So — and I know that it might not have been quite as important in times past, but now, because you're covered on
broadcast television, you're covered on the internet, people know you're there and you're making a case. And you're respecting
another country and another country's leaders enough to be in their palace, in their office, in their parliament.

And I have found that it eases the way for building interpersonal relations, which at the end of the day are at the root of much of what
we do in foreign relations. Doesn't mean that people are going to give up their self-interest or change their human nature. That's not
going to happen. But that there may be an opening that you can take advantage of to make a case that might otherwise not have been
heard if you were just barking orders at them from a thousand miles away.

QUESTION: Yeah. I know. You know what? I'm all about relationships, not transactions, and I see that in you--

SECRETARY CLINTON:        Yeah.

QUESTION: -- in how you do your job.

SECRETARY CLINTON: It really matters. It matters. It's always mattered.

QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SECRETARY CLINTON:        But it especially matters in the world today.

QUESTION:     I see that loud and clear. Okay. And then in the week of October, I noticed on your schedule — well, is there anything
about the UN, was there any key — you also met with people that are higher than you --

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, right.

QUESTION: -- because Obama left all that to you. Was there any key meeting that I should focus on?

SECRETARY CLINTON:        Well, I mean, gosh, there were so many. I mean --

QUESTION:     I mean, the bulk of it was unbelievable, but was there one moment that was the one I should pick out --

SECRETARY CLINTON:        Oh, I don't--

QUESTION: -- that was particularly sensitive or --

SECRETARY CLINTON: Let me think about that, Monica.

QUESTION: Okay.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Because, I mean, we had very intense conversations with the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan and
Egypt and --

QUESTION: Yeah.

SECRETARY CLINTON: -- Yemen and Libya and — (laughter)—

QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

SECRETARY CLINTON: I mean, it was a --

 QUESTION: Well, maybe you could tell Philippe --

 SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, yeah.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

QUESTION: -- what would be the best one to single out from that time period.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Okay. We'll go through — yeah.

QUESTION: I mean, the bulk of it — and then --

STAFF: We'll rank all 24.

QUESTION: (Laughter.) And then on October 1", that week, you led the U.S.-Afghanistan Bilateral Commission.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right.

QUESTION: Is that important?

SECRETARY CLINTON: It's very important.

QUESTION: Okay.

SECRETARY CLINTON: It's part of— we negotiated something called a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Afghanistan as a
way of both committing ourselves to an enduring partnership with the Afghans, having an agenda that we would both follow so that
there wouldn't be second-guessing and finger-pointing. We would say, "Look, here's what we want to work on together, and here's

how we have to proceed." And this was the first of those meetings. And I found it to be much desired on the Afghan side, and on
ours as well because we wanted to clarify what we were going to be focusing on together.

QUESTION: Even after the — what's been happening with the suicide --

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, right.

QUESTION: -- acts and all that? Okay.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right, right.

QUESTION: Okay. Okay. Now, what do you want to be your legacy?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, gosh. I have not stopped to think about that.

QUESTION: Really?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Again, I will stop to think about it maybe in three months.

QUESTION: Okay.

SECRETARY CLINTON: I'm so in the moment. People say to me, "What are you going to do next? Looking back, what's your
legacy?"

QUESTION: Yeah, that's coming to — yeah, yeah, yeah.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Honestly, I can't answer those questions because I just haven't allowed myself to stop and think them
through. And I don't want to divert my mind from what's going on right now. There's too much going on right now that I have to be
 focused on, so I'll let the rest work itself out.

QUESTION: Do you think, given the way the world is right now and how tough this last few weeks has been, have you even given a
 thought to maybe staying as Secretary of State?

 SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, a lot of people have talked to me about that, but I --

 QUESTION: But has the President?

 SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I'm not going to go into any conversations with anybody, but I would be unlikely to do that. I
 really made up my mind — now, at least a year or so ago — and I want to follow through on that. Because I think it's important for me

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

to jusstep off the incredibly high wire that I've been on for the last four years — actually for the last 20 years —just to take stock of the
rest of my life which is before me.

QUESTION: Yeah. And do you — I know you haven't given a lot of thought, but is there something that you just can't wait to do?

SECRETARY CLINTON:          Oh, yeah, sleep. Sleep would bgood.

QUESTION: How do you balance all this? I mean, you do go nonstop.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, I do.

QUESTION: I mean, I've gained five pounds just travelling with you. (Laughter.) No joke. On that travel, it was an excuse to eat
shit. (Laughter.)

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, there's a lot of it around. (Laughter.)

QUESTION: Yeah. I mean, you just grab food. They're like, oh, well I need this to get through the day. And I wasn't even

performing like you are; I just sit here and do nothing. So I blame you for this. So how do you do it?

SECRETARY CLINTON: I take responsibility for that too. (Laughter.)

QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, exactly. (Laughter.) How do you, like, balance --

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first

QUESTION: -- this physically and also to be, like, a strong leader but also then have the compassion and the person? I mean, how
do you pull it off?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. Well, I mean, first, it's just who I am. And I don't think about it being anything other than going

about my business. But look, I do try to exercise, I do try to.eat right. I fall off the wagon on both. I do try to get enough sleep.

QUESTION: Yeah.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Not easy to do. Try to catch up it with whenever I can. But the work is so consuming, intellectually
demanding, with such high stakes — literally life and death at stake —

QUESTION: Yeah.

SECRETARY CLINTON: -- that I am constantly thinking and planning and reacting, trying to manage this extraordinary panoply
of issues around the world that I think are going to affect my country, my daughter, the future that I would like to see, and so it gets
me up every day and keeps me going till late at night.

QUESTION: And do you — your colleagues here tell me — you've got a great team, by the way — I have so much fun with them --

SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you.

QUESTION: -- and they're all very talented.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you.

QUESTION: But do you — they all tell me how you're always searching for the next best organizer.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes.

 QUESTION: Saying you're always looking for the next best binder or — so what is this about you that you --

 SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.) It's almost a game that I play with myself. When you have as much coming at you as I do
 every day, it's kind of a constant joke we have. Okay, our cards or paper or our boxes or some other form of storage — I mean, it's just
 a way of kind of keeping it light, because there's so much serious that we have to do all the time.

 QUESTION: And do you — is it true that the President gave you, like, an inscribed iPad cover or something?

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

SECRETARY CLINTON:        Well, he gave me a great iPad cover that has my initials on it, which was really very welcome because
it's hard, so when you travel as much, it doesn't get knocked around.

QUESTION:    Was it for a particular occasion? Or did you see one that he had or what?

SECRETARY CLINTON:        We were just talking one day. We do that. I mean, I gave

QUESTION: I    know you're going to see him after me.

SECRETARY CLINTON:        Very—yeah, veryshortly, yeah.

QUESTION:    I'll be happy to go with you. (Laughter.)

SECRETARY CLINTON:        Oh, I know. I gave him an espresso machine one time. We were talking about good espresso and how
hard it was to find. And I really enjoy my time with him, and I also know probably better than anybody because of what —the

positions that I've had, and the respect I have for how hard —how impossible the job has always been, but certainly is today. It's not
all bad news. I mean, there's a lot of bad news I have to deliver, a lot of difficult issues I have to raise, a lot of hard questions he has
to grapple with. So it's nice every so often to —like when Bo the dog came in to see Aung San Suu Kyi, when I went to see --

QUESTION:    Oh, well, I wanted to ask about that --

SECRETARY CLINTON:        Oh, when I went to see her in Burma, I brought her gifts, which you do when you travel through
protocol. But I brought a gift for her dog —she adores her dog —and the dog was such good company when she was under house
arrest. And so when she went to the White House to see the President, she really wanted to meet Bo the dog who she had heard about,
and the President was so great.

QUESTION:    Oh, that's cool.

SECRETARY CLINTON:        He had Bo outside the Oval Office and when the meeting ended he said, "Oh, wait, one more person I
want you to meet," right? And in came Bo the dog. She was so thrilled. I mean, we try to make it not just a grind because it could be
with everything going on in the world, literally just debilitating —trying to figure out the right thing to do. how best to protect
America, how to get our values across, how to deal with intractable situations like the ones we face in so many places. So every so
often, we kind of lighten it up.

 QUESTION:    Which I forgot to mention in my little timetable of the action profile about you —you did see her when she was here
 and you said you know something about being kind of an icon and becoming a politician, what that entails.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:       Yes, yes, yes, yes.

 QUESTION:    And you had her to your home for a dinner.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:       I did. I did.

 QUESTION:    And can you tell me a little about that and what that meant to you?

 SECRETARY CLINTON:       Well, I --

 QUESTION:    Had she been to your home before?

 SECRETARY CLINTON:       No, no.

 QUESTION:    Okay.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:        She hadn't been in the United States in, I think, 40 years.

 QUESTION:    Oh, wow.

 SECRETARY CLINTON:        We can check that, but I think it's like 40 years. She had me in her home, and it was such an emotional
 experience, and obviously I wanted to reciprocate. And so I had her in my home and we had a very small dinner. And before the

 dinner, I spent about an hour with her just talking like two old friends, because I had felt when I met her for the first time that we'd
 been friends forever. And I just so highly admire her, but I also have such affection for her.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

QUESTION: Now you did talk about what it's like to be a politician and things like that --

SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right, right

QUESTION: -- and get into the nitty-gritty. Now your approval rating right now is close to 70 percent. So a lot of people are asking
the obvious question: What about 2016? And people — do you think now people --

STAFF: I thought the obvious question was: Who are the other 30? (Laughter.)

QUESTION: Well, yeah. What happened with the other 30? How are they not approving? (Laughter.) So do you — I mean, do you
think that — why do you think people see you now differently than when you were running for office, or --

SECRETARY CLINTON: I can't even speculate on that, Monica, because I feel like I've always been the same, other than perhaps

my hairstyles, which have changed over the last 65 years.

QUESTION: (Laughter.) Haven't we all, though? Yeah, even men's.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, indeed.

QUESTION: It's not just women.

SECRETARY CLINTON: But I feel like I've been the same person but in different roles over time. And I appreciate the fact that
people are favorably inclined and supporting what I'm trying to do as Secretary, but I can't really venture a theory as to why or why
not. I just have to get up every day and do the best I can.

QUESTION: Do you think there's a difference, Hillary, in seeing you running and campaigning versus governing? Or --

SECRETARY CLINTON: Could be. Could be.

QUESTION: But you — do you have a — do you give it any thought?

 SECRETARY CLINTON: I really don't. I really don't.

 QUESTION: Okay. Well, you're too busy to even think about it. So there we have — a lot of people think you've got to run in 2016
 and that service is so important to you that, ultimately, if it's there, they can't imagine you would say no. Now of course, it's not as
 easy as everybody thinks it's going to be. (Laughter.) They think it's going to be there for the taking for you.

 SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right. Well, but I have always believed in service, but I did not for — what, 53 years of my life —

 ever believe I would run for office. I respected people who did like my husband and supported a lot of candidates over the course of
 my adulthood and —actually even before —I was a Goldwater girl when I was —I don't know —whatever grade I was.

 So I don't know why it would be surprising that I said, look, I intend to do service, but I intend to do service in a different capacity —
 going back to the advocacy community, working on women and girls, working in the Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative --

 QUESTION: So you wouldn't start your own foundation since you've got that big apparatus there that's so successful.

 SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, yeah. I mean, I think — I mean, and it seems to me that there's just a great opportunity to expand
 what we're doing, to deepen it in areas that I'm interested in. But again, I haven't made any decisions. I just know that I will always
 want to be of service. I believe in service. And one of my mentors, Marian Wright Edelman, and — used to quote all the time that
 service is the rent we pay for living on this earth, and I think that's exactly right.

 QUESTION: But you're not ruling it out?

 SECRETARY CLINTON: I have ruled it out. I have ruled it out. (Laughter.)

 QUESTION: Oh, my God. I don't want you to say that. I think it would be more fun if you said — (laughter) — I've not ruled it
 out. (Laughter.)

 SECRETARY CLINTON: That's funny.

 QUESTION: Seriously. Okay. So is there anything else that — in this action profile about you that you think I've got to include that
 I'm missing.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, my gosh. I don't know.

QUESTION: Of course, I wanted to talk to the President and Chelsea, but Philippe said no.

STAFF: I did.

QUESTION: And he did. (Laughter.)

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. He's a hard taskmaster.

QUESTION: Isn't he?

SECRETARY CLINTON: I don't know. I'll think about it. I mean, I — that period was so —

QUESTION: It was so jam-packed.

SECRETARY CLINTON: -- jam-packed.

STAFF: (Inaudible) you have to be more specific. What did you actually want?

QUESTION: What do you mean?

STAFF: Tell her what you actually asked for.

QUESTION: Oh. Oh, I wanted — you mean, like, just hang out? Like, go on a —

STAFF: No. You wanted —

QUESTION: Oh, I wanted to have dinner in New York with you and the President and Chelsea.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh. (Laughter.)

QUESTION: That's what I asked for. Or breakfast.

SECRETARY CLINTON: I want to do that. (Laughter.)

QUESTION: Or coffee. (Laughter.) That's what I asked for. And then I said I just want to hang out with Hillary and just know

what it's like to be Hillary. I asked for all kinds of things, and he thought I was like a nutcase.

STAFF: She wanted to take a walk with you.

QUESTION: Oh, yeah. I said I could go for a walk. Oh, God. I did once. When I did the profile of Michele Bachmann, I went for
a walk with her. Oh, my God, she like freaking wanted to kill me. Do you know what I mean? She does this fast walk. And so I was

carrying my little recorder, and then all I could hear when I played it back was like me like that. (Laughter.) You know what I
mean? She was, like, going to run me into the damn ground.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, my gosh. You did a profile on her?

QUESTION: Back when she — the two week period she was surging in Iowa at the start of the Republican's — and then she was gone
as all the Republicans popped up and then were gone.

SECRETARY CLINTON: That's funny.

QUESTION: Do you know what I mean? But anyway — (laughter) — all right, now, let's see. And then the other thing I was going
to get into was just the — how you have to be a leader and the muscular part of you versus the compassionate, the pragmatic part of

you, but the lofty goals part of you.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.

 QUESTION: So is there anything in this last few five weeks that you think kind of puts you there?

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

SECRETARY CLINTON:       Well, yeah. I mean, I think — look, I mean, what happened in Benghazi, but also elsewhere in the
Middle East. I mean, I had to get on the phone and really strongly demand that governments do more to take care of our people. I had
to be present for the State Department family when we lost four colleagues and do it in a way that was respectful but demonstrating
the emotion that we all felt. So —

QUESTION: Would that be like that video hookup you did wit— — in

SECRETARY CLINTON: In Libya? In Tripoli? Probably, yeah.

QUESTION: Would that be one? Or here?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, yeah. I mean, we did so much. We reached out to so many people. I personally did.

QUESTION: And then you of course talked to his sister on the phone and stuff like that.

SECRETARY CLINTON:       Yeah. So Chris's sister and then went over to — we went out to Andrews early and met all the family
members.

QUESTION: And before you got — somebody told me before you got out of the car on your way to Andrews, you were on the phone
to — which country were you on the phone and said,

"Get your people there"? Oh, Tunisia, because there were attacks still continuing there and saying, "Get your people out there. No
excuses." Was it something like that?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, we had     —

QUESTION: Was it something like that? Would that be accurate?

SECRETARY CLINTON:       There were a lot of calls like that. We had a lot of threats.

QUESTION: So you had to be kind of a hard-ass.

SECRETARY CLINTON: We had a lot of threats everywhere. So — and remember, in a lot of these places, the security systems
just disappeared after the dictators disappeared. And so there's a difference between some countries where they did not have the
capacity, but they had the will and countries that don't have either the will or the capacity and countries that have the capacity but
without the will. So you have to zero in on what the right message is to each of those.

QUESTION: Well, what can you do if they have the capacity but not the will?

SECRETARY CLINTON: You just have to up the pressure as much as you can.

QUESTION: And how do you do that?

SECRETARY CLINTON: You get everybody you can on the phone, you get everybody calling everybody who needs to be on the

phone, and you basically both appeal to them doing the right thing and threaten them if they don't.

QUESTION: Which country would that have been?

SECRETARY CLINTON: No. No further than that. (Laughter.)

QUESTION:    Okay. All right. Okay. And t—en

STAFF:   That piece of paper was—the

QUESTION: That said she has to go? Because I could keep going to get more detail, more detail, more detail. (Laughter.)

STAFF: It's polite. We just set it up that she comes in and gets a blank piece of paper wi—h this — (laughter)

QUESTION: No, no. I saw it does have something written on it.

SECRETARY CLINTON:       Yeah. I have to leave for the White—House

 QUESTION: I couldn't read it.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

SECRETARY CLINTON: -- in about five minutes.

QUESTION: Oh, okay. (Laughter.) I did look. There was something on it, but I couldn't read it, unfortunately, through it.

SECRETARY CLINTON: That's funny.

QUESTION: Anyway, okay. And then on your legacy, since you didn't really get into that, the one thing is public diplomacy to me
seems to be one part of it — your townterviews and then the secretary of cool thing where you came that — it's all kind of this public

persona.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. Yeah.

QUESTION: The brand of Secretary of State in America. The economic statecraft seemed to me to be part of your —

SECRETARY CLINTON: Right. That's a big part of it.

QUESTION: Okay. And in that —

SECRETARY CLINTON: Internet freedom. I mean, we have a long list we could give you, which I'm sure you could —

QUESTION: And the Asia focus, like going to Beijing, it was one of your last trips, and it was your first trip.

SECRETARY CLINTON: My first trip, absolutely.

QUESTION: And then on the Arab Spring, that was something that you all were involved in and out of. Do you feel a little bit's
come back to bite you?

SECRETARY CLINTON: No.

QUESTION: Okay.

SECRETARY CLINTON: No. Because I do think that it's — it would be a contortion of who we are not to support people seeking
democracy and freedom and free markets.

QUESTION: Well, everybody said, actually, the day after September 11th that you had the star tone and did better than Obama. I

mean, all the critics thought you — everybody that we talked to thought that, that you had struck the right tone.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, look, I believe strongly that democracy is hard. It is a never-completed journey. I mean, we are
still working hard to make sure we live up to our own ideals and values, and I want to contextualize what's going on in the world. I
mean, these countries have gone from oppression of decades without any democratic history into a burst of revolutionary energy to try
to do something they've never done before.

And so it is hard. It's something that is going to take time, and I think the United States remains a beacon of hope and opportunity, an
example of freedom and dignity and human rights, but that doesn't mean we can control everything that happens in every country,
particularly within a revolutionary transition. But I would never have imagined that after something as horrific as the murder of our
four colleagues and the injury of others that you would have a protest — a pro-American protest in Libya demanding that those who
killed Chris Stevens and his colleagues were not the future that Libya wanted. I think that's a remarkable turn of events.

 And so we just have to be resolved that we're going to do the best we can to stand for our values, protect ourselves in a dangerous,
 fast-changing world, and manage as best we can this enormous flood of change that is sweeping across the globe. But with that, I'm
 going to have to —

 QUESTION: Okay. I understand.

 SECRETARY CLINTON: -- head to the White House.

 QUESTION: Gotcha.

 SECRETARY CLINTON: All right, my dear.

 QUESTION: Okay. Thank you very much.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792589 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

       SUM M ARY: for the past several months, the question on NSC Senior
       Director for Asia Jeff Bader was not   ifhe would step down for the private
       sector, but when.  Now the answer is official...this Friday, April 15.

       The questions behind that    question for m onths have centered on
       who/where will China policy be form ulated and enforced, what's up with
       Korea policy, especially toward North Korea, and who will be the lead on

       Japan?

       In brief, inform ed sources firm ly m aintain that the answer to  allthree is
       "right where It's been all along, at the W hite H ouse and the

       NSC." Tonight's headlines give you the "bulletin".

       O n the K orea policy Item m ost under public discussion...food aid to the
       North.. Itdoesn't sound like any decision to change US policy is com ing

       anytim e soon, despite W FP's findings, and anything Jim m y Carter m ight
       com e out w ith. D etails, below .

       On Friday night's "last hour" deal between the President, and the Speaker,
       with the Senate M ajority Leader in attendance, m ost analysts agree that

       It's a big win for Boehner, a critical win/save for O bam a, but also
       som ething of a work in progress, since it turns out that "thousands" of
       budget details rem ain to be determ ined, yet the H ouse is supposed to vote
       on W ednesday, followed on Thursday by the Senate.

       And O bam a has now set a W ednesday speech to do what the W hite H ouse
       had been under severe criticism for agt doing up to this point.. .setting out
       clear details and desired bottom lines on the tough questions. A ccording
       to the pre-speech briefings underw ay, the President, it is claim ed, w ill call

       for m ajor cuts in defense, he'll reach out to the Republicans with calls for
       m ajor cuts in M edicare and M edicaid, and he'll try to keep the very, very
       antsy Dem ocratic base happy with a call to end the Bush tax cut on "the
       w ealthy", defined as those m aking m ore than $250,000 a year.

       The W hite H ouse calculates (hopes) that the D em ocratic base w ill com e to
       see O bam a's plan as courageous in the face of the H ouse Republican
       budget of chairm an Ryan, which proposes draconian reform s on M edicare
       and M edicaid, including basically dum ping the costs down onto the states
       with no serious plan to deal with rising costs, and continues the G O P

       argum ent that revoking the Bush tax cut is a "hike", and therefore
       unacceptable.

       W hether all this proves to be prem ature is a question worth asking, since

       the real T-Parties/GOP freshm an reaction to Friday's budget deal rem ains
       to be quantified, and som e curm udgeons rem em ber that the first
       "agreem ent" between then-President Clinton and then-Speaker Gingrich
       w as defeated.

       O n balance, m ost observers feel the Frosh won't want to pull the rug out
       from under Boehner with the real fights only now getting started...but
       there's still som e tough talk from the Frosh about holding the line now in
       preparation for the Debt Lim it fight, itself seen by the budget radicals as

       an essential first step in fighting O bam a (and Boehner?) on FY'12.

       The W hite House today tried to do an "oops, never m ind" on then-Sen.
       O bam a's fam ous vote against   extending the Dept Lim it back in 2006,

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780569 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

        saying he now understands w hy that w as a m istake to charge the Bush
        W hite H ouse with "shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs

        of our children and grandchildren. Am erica has a debt problem and a
        failure of leadership, Am ericans deserve better."

        Likely his words back then will be liberally thrown at him now, hence the

        decision today to confront it with a m ix of hum ility and panic, spokesm an
        Carney calling refusal to extend the Debt Lim it "Arm ageddon-
        like...devestating...dangerous...catastrophic...ca iam itous".

        O n what's increasingly looking like a nasty stalem ate in Libya, unless
        som e deus ex m achina event som ehow rem oves G addafi, observers say
        the increasingly aggressive international m ilitary role being played by
        France, under President Sarkozy, is intended to let Gaddafi know that as

        went (today) the form er Cote d'Ivoire dictator/war crim inal, so too will
        Gaddafi if he won;t leave voluntarily.

        This tid bit is fascinating, and way out of our geographical com fort zone,

        this, below. M eanwhile, Sec St Clinton today reacted with caution to the
        Libyan rebels rejection of the Africa Union's cease-fire proposal which

        would have allowed G addafi to stay around.

        FTA SCHEDULE GETTING CLEARER? With the following, courtesy of The

        W ashington Trade Daily, we should hear shortly from Speaker Boehner
        (perhaps thru W ays &amp; M eans chair Camp) that the informal "hold" has
        been lifted on starting with Capitol Hill on the KORUS implementing

        legislation.

        WASHINGTON TRADE DAILY Alert — Moving the FTAs

        The US-Colombia free trade agreement could be ready to go Congress "In a matter of
        weeks," Deputy US Trade Representative Miriam Sapiro said today.

        The Obama Administration wants to work with Congress on a timeline for moving the
        three FTAs -- with Panama and South Korea -- along with other trade initiatives important
        to the White House. Those include renewal of the expired Andean and Generalized

        System of Preferences trade programs, expanded Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits
        and permanent normal trade relations for Russia. "We don't want to leave any single
        one behind" she told reporters following remarks to the NDN.

        KORUS is ready for Congress and Panama is expected to complete the last step it needs

        to take - approval if a tax information exchange
        agreement very soon, she said.

         "with caution" to a rejection of the Africa Union's cease-fire proposal by

       Libyan rebel leaders, who objected to anything allowing Gaddafi to rem ain
       in power. Clinton leaves later this week for m ore NATO foreign m inisters
       m eeting on Libya, and then on to South Korea and Japan.

        Reuters reports speculation that Clinton's m ission in Seoul is part of a
       "diplom atic flurry that seem s to be designed to resum e talks on ending
        North Korea's nuclear programs", adding "A South Korean nuclear envoy

       Is in W ashington this week to m eet top officials, including Deputy
       Secretary of State Jim Steinberg and Stephen Bosworth, the US Special
        Representative for North Korea policy."

       W e'll discuss the K orea aspect below.

       O n Libya, bservers speculate that Clinton and the President don't want to
        preclude anything w hich m ight produce a cessation of hostilities, given the
        pressure O bam a Is under from dom estic critics of US over-extension in

       "three wars".

        M eanwhile, this from Loyal Reader (and form er Sen. Byrd colleague)
        Richard M edley, M edley Global Advisors, to his clients this morning, on the

        increasingly aggressive role of France in the Ivory C oast, as a possible
        "preview" of more to come in Libya:

       "Whether the French turned over Gbagbo or "let" Quattara's forces
       capture him is irrelevant. Today they showed a willingness to move and

       move powerfully when it was time to end a fruitless stand-off.

       Hello Tripoli. Discussions with several senior officials at State, the NSC,
        and important diplomatic posts in Europe paint a picture of an

       administration that hopes the defection of Musa Kusa, as well as the
       outreach by former Deputy Foreign Minister (now Foreign Minister) Obeidi
        and Sail al Islam Khadafy indicate a fracturing regime.

        They recognize, however, that it may take a while for that to

        happen. After all, Gbagbo held out for six months of intense military and
        diplomatic pressure, despite walking out of the compound looking like
        Gandhi after being on the Atkins' Diet.

        We are in the middle of that process with Khadafy, although defections,

        etc., are running hotter now. The dictator and his regime want to stay in
        place in Tripolitania. The threat of a prolonged stalemate and a de facto
        partition of the country into a rump Tripolitania and rump Cyrenaica (this
        reflects long-standing divides in Libya since the time of the Ottomans) is a

        very real prospect but US and French officials sincerely believe today's
        strong action will ring a bell..."

        NSC ASIA POLICY...we can confirm that NSC Senior Director for Asia Jeff
        Bader will form ally leave the W hite House staff this Friday, April 15. He'll
        take a two week personal break, then start work at the Brookings
        Institution on M ay 2.

        Bader's successor (as long ago reported by Josh Rogin, aive credit where
        it is due!) will be his deputy for Korea, career State Departm ent Japan and
        Korea expert Danny Russell.

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780569 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

        Bader's im m ediate plans are to think about writing a book, presum ably
       about China policy, and to contem plate various private consulting options.

       Since the likelihood of Bader's retirem ent and the prom otion of Russell
       first hit the gossip m ill, there have been additional senior foreign and
       defense policy officials also on the m ove, including Deputy Secretary of

       State Jim Steinberg at the end of April, to be replaced, the Senate willing,
       by Under Secretary Political Bill Burns, and Lt. Gen. W allace "Chip"
       Gregson, Asst. Sec. East Asia at DOD, apparently to be replaced by Obam a
       intim ate, form er NSC staffer M ark Lippert...although sources lately say

       that one is not (yet?) 100% .

       Also leaving DOD is Gregson's Principal DAS, Derek M itchell, slated for the
       long-vacant Burm a Special Envoy position, which also requires Senate

       confirm ation. Sources agree M itchell is a popular choice, and substantive
       opposition Is not expected. The gossip m ill on his replacem ent as PDAS
       has to date been useless.. if you know som ething, you know w hat to do on
       that, as well as Lippert.

       The Bader m ove has long been under (until now) private discussion in the
        policy com m entariat, and it's no secret that the China constituency has
        been increasingly anxious that with each departure, the cadre of

       established, senior "China people" in the Obam a Adm inistration gets
       sm aller and sm aller.

       The "announcem ent" of Bader's im m inent departure, via a carefully placed

        item in Saturday's New York Tim es, com ing on the heels of the Steinberg
       and DO D changes noted above, has naturally stim ulated intense discussion
       of who (both people, and beauracracy) will now be in charge of which
       aspects of A sia policy.

        Let's mention, in order, China, Korea and Japan policy, but first, on the
        continued overall primacy of the NSC:

        W ith the rise of the enorm ously respected Bill Burns from
        UnderSecState/Political to Deputy, and with A/S EAP Kurt Campbell, a

        seasoned Asia hand, rem aining in place, there has been m uch speculation
        that the W hite H ouse m ight be ceding the lead on China policy to State,
        since there will be no senior career "China hands" on the NSC.

        Such speculation is wrong, we are reliably, and indeed, firm ly inform ed, as
        it m anages to overlook the increasing involvem ent of National Security
        Advisor Tom Donilon directly on China policy at the highest levels. M ost
        recently, it is noted, Donilon accom panied Bader to Bejing to "advance"
        the Obam a/Hu Sum m it here in W ashington.

        Further, it is argued, Obam a's close com rade from the Cam paign, Deputy
        National Security Advisor Denis M cDonough, not only will remain in the
        W hite House, but will continue his role of recent m onths in "rigorously

        chairing the Deputies m eetings on both Korea/N. Korea and Japan policy".

        (See the next section on K orea policy per se.)

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780569 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

        And Russell, of course, is a highly respected career FS0 NE Asia expert,
         with language, on both Japan and K orea, sources note, adding that in

         recent m onths he has had increasing "face tim e" with the President, in
        addition to building working relationships with M cDonough and Donlion.
        That he has won their confidence is clear, through his com ing prom otion,
         It is noted.

         Finally, in term s of assum ed tectonic shifts in the balance of pow er
         betw een State and the W hite H ouse, an observer of the turf w ars endem ic
        to W ashington notes, even w ith all the changes underw ay, "not since the

        days of H enry K issinger have you had a situation where State called the
         play on China, not the W hite H ouse, and I can tell you that Isn't going to
         change under Obama!"

        OK, fair enough, but the US-China "engagem ent calendar" helps explain
        the quite frankly expressed (If always "on background") concerns about
        the practical im plications of the departures of Bader and Steinberg, known
         prim arily for their years of personal China expertise and high-level

         contacts.

         It was certainly m ade very clear in public that A/S EAP Cam pbell carried
         the m ajor sherpa's load in negotiating the final details of the O bam a-H u

         "Joint Statem ent" on policy across the board, although, of course, final
         approval cam e from Obam a/M cDonough/Bader.

         W ith the Security &amp; Econom ic Dialogue com ing up so soon, on M ay 10,
         concerned observers, and critics, ask who will be carrying the load for the

         "Security" part, given that, of course, Treasury's Geithner will continue to
         have the financial/econom ic portfolio in hand. ..see Friday's decision to
         again delay the Currency M isalignm ent Report to Congress?

         One frankly skeptical non-Adm inistration China hand worries as follows:

         "Chris,

         In the next three months, we have:

            1.  Human rights bilat.
            2. S&amp;ED talks on May 9-10
            3. Central M ilitary Commission "senior member" Chen Bingde visit (to

                US)
            4. VP Biden visit (to China)
            5. Presum ed Hu successor Xi Jinping visit (to US)

         In the midst of this, we've got changes at DOD, DOS, AND the NSC?? Then,

         the newbies are ALL non-China experts? And finally, the bureaucracies are
         ALL going to have to adjust SIMULTANEOUSLY? Was this by design, or just
         accident? And anyhow, given the calendar, why couldn't POTUS get ANY of
         them to delay their moves/departures?"

         KOREA POLICY...we noted at the top of Reuters Libya piece its speculation

         that Clinton to Seoul is part of a "diplom atic flurry designed to try to
         resum e talks on ending North Korea's nuclear program s".

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780569 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

       Presum ably the anonym ous State Departm ent source who said som ething
       nice about Jim m y Carter's planned m ission helped feed this im pression.
       Frankly, from our conversation with Adm inistration policy-m akers on this,
       w e urge not to exaggerate either the situation, or the m issions or either
       Carter or Clinton.

       As we Just reported, above, there is not going to be any dim unition of
       Korea policy control by the W hite House insofar as Deputy National
       Security Advisor M cDonough is concerned, and with soon to be Sr. Director
       Russell's professional specialty, his views on K orea policy will continue to

       be those m ost im m ediately at hand.

       Substantively, on food aid: despite som e characteristically optim istic, or
       hum anistically phrased Congressional testim ony by State's Cam pbell;

       backed-up by Steve Bosworth, that the US "isn't going to let anyone
       starve", w e do not detect any lessening of the fundam ental skepticism of
       why It's a good thing to resum e food aid to the DPRK under current
       circum stances.

       "W e are not in any hurry" is said, if privately, tim e and tim e again.

       And as Bosworth and Campbell both were careful to explain to Capitol Hill,
       the hum ane instincts of the Am erican people will be filtered through the
       very practical constraints im posed by the history of what the W hite H ouse
       sees as a dem onstrable history of diversion of food assistance from needy

       wom en and children to K im regim e supporters, especially the m ilitary.

       W e've spent m uch of the past week running the pros and cons of resum ing
       food aid to N. K orea, so need not repeat the argum ents tonight.

       The bottom line: until or unless a fully reliable verification regim e is

       agreed to and is up and running in the DPRK, Obam a policy is going to
       rem ain in place, we'd argue, even If the S. Korean governm ent changes Lts
       m ind about the situation, which seem s highly unlikely without som e
       overall im provem ent in N/S relations (the preconditions for which are well
       known).

        Finally, even if It's decided to try to forge ahead with N. Korea, this W hite
        H ouse is fully aware of the practical problem s encountered, dating from
        back in the Clinton Adm inistration, when it tried to get m oney from
       Congress for N. Korea, even If to support a nuclear freeze

        agreem ent. W ith Republicans now firm ly in control of the H ouse, this
        situation is back in play, in full force.

        JUDGE MORRIS/GLOBAL BUSINESS DIALOGUE...TODAY'S              TTALK...

        REFLECTION ON A GREEN LIGHT

        "We've been working on getting a green light for this [the FTA with the United
        States] to go to Congress for five years, and we got that green light today."

        Juan Manuel Santos

        April 7 2011

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780569 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

         "So today, I am very pleased to announced that we have developed an action plan for

         labor rights in Colombia... .Now there's obviously a lot of work to do to translate this
         action plan into reality."

         Barack Obamq,
         April 7, 2011

        Context:   On Wednesday, April 6, the White House issued a very positive
         statement on the pending free-trade agreement with Colombia. The statement
         explained that the Obama administration has been working hard with the
         Colombian government to resolve outstanding issues and said that:

                "The result is an agreed "Action Plan Related to Labor Rights" that will lead
                to greatly enhanced labor rights in Colombia and clear the way for the
                U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement to move toward Congress."

         On Thursday, April 7, President Santos called on President Obama at the White

         House, which provided the opportunity for a joint press briefing. Today's quotes
         were taken from that briefing.

        Comment:     Unquestionably, last week's announcements- the action plan, the
         press briefing, all of it - were a major step forward in the life of this long-drawn
         out agreement. To recap, it is an agreement that was first discussed in 2003,

        signed in 2006, and submitted to Congress by President Bush in 2008, only to be
        dispatched to a diplomatic holding pen where it has languished ever since.

        Our impression is that many if not most of the American supporters of this
        agreement believe that, at last, the deal is done. Yes, Congress needs to act, but
         the votes are there and it is simply a matter of time - and presumably not much

         time - before the agreement is approved and implemented. And such an
        interpretation probably comports well With the President's intentions. In the
        same press conference, for example, President Obama said he was looking
         forward to attending the Summit of the Americas next year in Cartagena,
        Colombia. That will be a pretty awkward meeting if the U.S.-Colombia FTA isn't
         up and running by then.

         Not everyone is sanguine about the future of this deal, however. According to a
         recent Wall Street Journal article, the people of Colombia still only give the
         agreement a 50 percent chance of being approved by the U.S. Congress. And
         presumably those who find the deal inadequate - organizations like the AFL-CIO
         and political leaders like Rep. Sander Levin (Dem. - Michigan) are prepared to

         fight against it.

         Exegesis. One way to look at all of this is to ask questions of the text from last
         Thursday's remarks by the two presidents. When President Obama said there is a lot

         of work to do, just how much work did he have in mind and over what time period?
         When President Santos said, "We got that green light today," it sounded as if he
         meant that the last obstacles facing the agreement had been cleared away. And
         indeed, that's probably what he did mean, and he may have been

         right. Alternatively, this agreement's journey may be far from over, with more
         obstacles, more intersections, more red lights still ahead.

         "PERSPECTIVE"...Loyal Reader Dean Cheng, of the Heritage Foundation's
        Asia Studies Center, like most of us, has been worried about/thinking
         about recent trends in Chinese policy across the board. Dean says this
         piece, while published today, was prepared before last Friday's State
         Department Annual Report on Human Rights...the substance of which on

         China he would have mentioned, and praised:

         China's Crackdown and America's Response: Supporting
         Liberty in Distant Places

         The Heritage Foundation, WASHINGTON, April 11, 2011

         As the "Jasmine Revolution" continues to unravel traditional power structures in the
         Middle East, Chinese authorities have been cracking down on dissidents and activists on a
         scale not seen in over a decade. On the eve of the next round of Strategic and Economic
         Dialogue talks, and with much less experienced Asia team members for the U.S.-many of
         whom have no China experience-there will be great pressure to overlook these harsh

         measures. But doing so would not help the dissidents but instead betray American ideals.
         Reasons  for the Crackdown
         Western media has noted the arrest of Ai Weiwei, an internationally recognized artist.
         But other reports indicate that a host of activists, human rights lawyers, and dissidents
         have been detained. Reports suggest that at least 20, and perhaps between 50 and a

         hundred people have been arrested or have otherwise disappeared.ill
         Part of this effort is almost certainly in reaction to developments in the Middle East. Very
         clearly, the Chinese authorities are worried that the winds of popular discontent and
         demands for political reform will blow through China. This is likely exacerbated by
         possible similarities in the domestic situation in China and parts of the Middle East. These

         include increasing frustration with corruption and growing disparities between urban and
         rural populations. Both of these are likely factors in the mounting number of "mass
         incidents" reported throughout China, now likely exceeding 100,000 a year.
         Less widely recognized is the issue of urban unemployment. In the Middle East, there is a
         large population of underemployed, educated youth in the cities. Officially, this is much

         less of a problem in China, where urban unemployment at the end of 2010 was only 4.1
         percent. Yet Chinese articles nonetheless document a similar phenomenon of

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780569 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

         underemployed and unemployed youths congregating in cities such as Beijing, Nanjing,
         and Chongqing. Often referred to as "ants," they are believed to number anywhere from
         a million to 3 million.al Like the urban youth in Tunisia and Egypt, they constitute

         potential tinder for any kind of popular movement against government controls-educated
         yet dissatisfied.
         The current crackdown may be further motivated by the upcoming plenary meeting of
         the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is reported that this meeting may determine the
         makeup of the next Politburo Standing Committee, the true Chinese leadership.
         Instability in the streets not only may disrupt the plenum but would potentially also

         Introduce unpredictable factors into the various factions' maneuvering for power and
         advantage. For all the involved parties, there is likely to be great interest in limiting the
         potential for embarrassing incidents.
         Don't Get Your Hopes Up
         Several recent Chinese publications provide additional food for thought regarding this

         crackdown. The Twelfth Five Year Plan (2011-2015) shows that Beijing will spend more
         on internal security forces than on the military.21 In addition, the 2010 Chinese defense
         white paper, which was released only last week, prominently notes that a major task of
         the Chinese military is to "maintain social harmony and stability." 1_41 The People's
         Armed Police, part of the Chinese armed forces, is given this task on a day-to-day basis,
         but it is important to remember that the People's Liberation Army is the armed wing of

         the CCP. There should be no doubt that, if necessary, the Party will use every available
         means to enforce its will.
         Meanwhile, Global Times,part of the People's Daily   newspaper system published by the
         CCP, editorialized that Ai Weiwei's arrest was not for his dissidence but for his violation
         of Chinese laws.151 The editorial highlights a growing trend in Chinese suppression of
         dissidents: the aggressive use of the law as a rationalization for punishment. As one
         Chinese official warned foreign journalists who were assaulted by police, for those who

         seek to make trouble for China, the law is not a shield and offers no protection.M
         This attitude of rule by law rather than rule of law should disabuse those optimists who
         had looked to Wen Jiabao's speeches as presaging some kind of fundamental political
         reform or even the stirrings of democracy. That even high-profile dissidents can be legally
         punished simply for pushing the limits highlights how concepts of "legal warfare" apply
         not only internationally but domestically.

         As long as the CCP remains in power, there will be little meaningful movement toward
         democracy. The CCP has little incentive to cede power. Indeed, recent events in the
         Middle East only underscore, from the Party's perspective, that loss of power ultimately
         leads to exile and at worst to civil war-a very zero-sum view. Belief that democracy is
         "just around the corner" is, of course, foolish. But, as Wu Bangguo emphasized at the
         recent National People's Congress, "We will never simply copy the system of Western
         countries or introduce a system of multiple parties holding office in rotation."Elj

         Recommendations
         The U.S. should:
             •   Retain the Tiananmen Square sanctions. Leaving aside the national security

                 implications of the Tiananmen sanctions, it is important that the leadership
                 in Beijing recognize that its actions have consequences. In particular, when a
                 government turns its guns on its own people, it must know that this will be

                 deemed unacceptable behavior and that it will not change simply with the
                 passage of time. In this regard, Washington should also persuade its allies to
                 keep those sanctions in place. Otherwise, they would have little meaning and

                 less impact.
             •   Link ideals and individuals. Supporting human rights is not only a matter of

               based aviation, American policymakers today should be supporting efforts at

               studying the potential for legal warfare, both offensively and defensively.
               Military lawyers should incorporate the study of foreign-and especially
               Chinese-laws and legal warfare into their training.

        What  Does the U.S. Stand For?
        The exceedingly dim prospects for democratic reform in China does not mean that the
        United States should abandon its support for it. Support for democracy worldwide is a
        fundamental American tenet, elemental to American ideals and principles. Both rhetoric
        and action are necessary.

Loose lips and the Obama national security ship

Posted at 7:09 pm by: By CNN's Adam Levine

By Adam Levine, with reporting from Pam Benson and Ann Colwell

The level of detail spilling out through media reports about crucial national security operations is raising the question of

whether President Barack Obama's administration can keep a secret — or in some cases even wants to.

In just the past week, two tell-all articles about Obama's leadership as commander-in-chief have been published,

dripping with insider details about his sleeves-rolled-up involvement in choosing terrorist targets for drone strikes and
revelations about his amped-up cyber war on Iran.

Each article notes the reporters spoke to "current and former" American officials and presidential advisers, as well as
sources from other countries.

"This is unbelievable ... absolutely stunning," a former senior intelligence official said about the level of detail contained
in the cyberattack story.

The official noted that the article cited participants in sensitive White House meetings who then told the reporter about
top secret discussions. The article "talks about President Obama giving direction for a cyberweapons attack during a

time of peace against a United Nations member state."

The article follows on the heels of what many considered dangerous leaking of details about a mole who helped foil a

 plot by al Qaeda in Yemen. The revelations of the British national threatened what was described at the time as an
 ongoing operation.

 "The leak really did endanger sources and methods," Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California and chair of the Intelligence
 Committee, told Fox News.

 The Yemen plot had many intelligence and national security officials flummoxed and angered by its public
 airing. Despite that, a senior administration official then briefed network counterterrorism analysts, including CNN's
 Frances Townsend, about parts of the operation.

 But such briefings are an "obligation" for the administration once a story like the Yemen plot is publicized, insisted
 National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor.

 "The reason that we brief former counterterrorism officials is because they are extremely conscientious about working
 with us about what can and cannot be said or disclosed," Vietor told Security Clearance. "They understand that there is

 an obligation for the U.S. to be transparent with American people about potential threats but will work with us to
 protect operational equities because they've walked in our shoes."

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05790750 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

Subsequently, the intelligence committee initiated a review of its agencies to assess the leak. The FBI launched an
investigation as well.

Perhaps the highest profile intelligence coupe for the administration, the killing of Osama bin Laden, was followed
almost immediately by criticism of how much detail was leaking out. Then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates

complained that after officials agreed in the Situation Room not to reveal operational details, it was mere hours before
that agreement was broken.

"The leaks that followed the successful bin Laden mission led to the arrest of Pakistanis and put in danger the mission's
heroes and their families," Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said in an interview on CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront."

Questions were raised about why details of documents and other articles that were seized during the raid were
discussed even before the intelligence community had time to review what they were holding.

Leon Panetta, who at the time was the director of the CIA and is now the defense secretary, penned a letter to CIA staff
warning against loose lips.

In the letter, obtained by CNN, Panetta wrote that the operation, "led to an unprecedented amount of very sensitive -
in fact, classified — information making its way into the press."

"Disclosure of classified information to anyone not cleared for it — reporters, friends, colleagues in the private sector or
other agencies, former agency officers — does tremendous damage to our work. At worst, leaks endanger lives," the
letter said.

In the latest case, the White House denied it was orchestrating the leak. Asked Friday if the Times' story detailing the
cyberattack on Iran was an "authorized leak," White House spokesman Josh Earnest disagreed "in the strongest possible

terms."

"That information is classified for a reason. Publicizing it would pose a threat to our national security," Earnest told

 reporters.

 But the White House has tried to be more open about what have been secretive programs. The president himself

 became the first administration official to acknowledge U.S. drones were conducting attacks in Pakistan when he made a
 comment to a supporter in an online chat, even though officials through all the years of the program had never said

 publicly they were being conducted.

 Then, in April, the president's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, John Brennan, publicly blew the

 cover off the drone program, saying in a speech that "yes, in full accordance with the law — and in order to prevent
 terrorist attacks on the United States and to save American lives — the United States government conducts targeted
 strikes against specific al Qaeda terrorists, sometimes using remotely piloted aircraft, often referred to publicly as

 drones."

 But that speech, Vietor told CNN's Security Clearance last month, was carefully considered for how revealing it could be.

 "I'm not going to get into internal deliberations, but as a general matter we obviously push to be as transparent as we
 can while being mindful of our national security equities," Vietor said.

Clinton Urges South Sudan, Sudan to Settle Oil

Dispute

By REUTERS
Published: August 3, 2012 at 6:53 AM ET
                JUBA (Reuters) - U.S.'Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday
       urged South Sudan and Sudan to end an oil dispute that has brought the

       neighbors to the brink of war, in the highest-level visit of a U.S. official to
       Juba since its independence a year ago.

Clinton visited Africa's newest nation for the first time on Friday, hours after a

U.S. Security Council deadline expired for the neighbors to solve a long list of
disputes, ranging from border security to oil payments.

Both nations came to the brink of a full war in April after border fighting

escalated, the worst violence since South Sudan became independent under a
2005 agreement that ended decades of civil war with Khartoum.

The duo's messy divorce has left unsolved where to mark the disputed border and
how much landlocked South Sudan should pay to export its oil through the north.
Oil is the lifeline of both economies.

Clinton said both nations should reach an oil agreement as a first step to end
hostilities. Juba sent both economies into turmoil when it shut down its oil

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791616 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

output in January to stop Khartoum seizing oil for what the latter called unpaid
fees.

"Now we need to get those (oil) resources flowing again," Clinton told reporters
after meeting South Sudan's President Salva Kiir for more than one hour in his
office where she hugged him upon arrival.

"A percentage of something is better than a percentage of nothing," she said,
referring to the importance of an oil deal.

"Both countries will need to compromise to close the remaining gaps between
them," she said during her 3-hour visit to Juba, part of an 11-nation African tour.

The African Union has been trying to mediate between the neighbors but talks

have made little progress. Both sides have made some concessions in oil talks but
remain far apart froma deal.

Sudan insists it wants a border security agreement first before agreeing on oil.
Khartoum accuses South Sudan of supporting rebels in two southern border
states, claims some diplomats find credible despite denial from Juba.

South Sudan itself accuses Khartoum of often bombing its side of the border.
Although Khartoum denies this Reuters reporters have witnessed several such
aerial attacks.

The United States is the biggest supporter of South Sudan which Washington
helped guide through years of talks with Khartoum that led to independence in
July 2011.

Prior to her Juba visit, Clinton called Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Ahmed Karti
on Wednesday to signal continued U.S. support for both nations to settle all
disputes peacefully, Sudanese state news agency SUNA said.

Washington shuns Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir who has been
indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in the Darfur region.
The United States also has a trade embargo on Sudan for its past role of hosting
Islamist militants such as Osama bin Laden.

If Assad Falls in Syria

Published: August 6, 2012

                 President Bashar al-Assad's security forces are continuing to kill Syrians in huge numbers, but the
opposition's chances of prevailing look better than they did six months ago. The challenge for the United States and its
partners is not just to step up the pressure, but also to prepare the ground for a constructive future for Syria.The

opposition scored a psychological victory on Monday when

 Prime Minister Riyad Farid Hijab defected to Jordan. Opposition leaders said that he brought along at least two

ministers and three military officers. Mr. Hijab, a Sunni Muslim, wasn't part of Mr. Assad's inner circle, but he was the
most senior civilian official and his defection is another sign of stress on the regime.

The rebels are challenging the Syrian Army

 in the cities of Damascus and Aleppo, but the fighting is likely to get worse. The conflict has already intensified splits
among the Sunni, Alawite and Christian communities; displaced thousands within Syria; sent thousands of refugees into

neighboring countries and threatened to destabilize the region. And there is increasing evidence that

 Al Qaeda and other jihadists have joined the fight.

The most viable diplomatic solution was a plan by the United Nations and the Arab League that would have eased Mr.
Assad out of power and begun a democratic transition. But Russia — with Iran, Mr. Assad's main protector — ensured it

would fail by arming the regime and refusing to impose sanctions.

The Obama administration and NATO have wisely resisted direct military involvement. That may change if, for example,

Mr. Assad tries to use chemical weapons against his people.

 For months, the administration has been increasing its involvement with the rebels — organizing a 130-nation pressure

group, working to unify opposition factions, helping them plan a political transition, providing intelligence and medical
aid and vetting which groups are extremists and which should get arms.

The administration has also begun to think beyond Mr. Assad's fall by planning how to cope with a new wave of
 refugees, maintain basic municipal services, restart a devastated economy and prevent the security forces from

disintegrating. American officials seem to have learned the lesson of Iraq, where the government collapsed, leaving
chaos behind. There is no guarantee Syria's rebels will want the help, but the administration has to be prepared to
 invest real money in these plans if they do.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05792281 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will have a chance to emphasize support for the rebels when she visits Turkey

later this week. The United States also needs to intensify sanctions on Syria and keep urging Russia to cooperate in
ending the conflict.

</span>
WASHINGTON        — U.S. Senator George LeMieux    (R-FL) today released the following statement regarding his
decision to allow the nomination of Tom Shannon to move forward. Mr. Shannon is nominated to be the next

U.S. ambassador to Brazil.

Senator LeMieux stated:

As a senator from Florida, the gateway to Latin America, it is incumbent upon me to focus on U.S. policy as it
relates to the Western Hemisphere. It is my assessment that U.S. foreign policy in the hemisphere stands at a
critical juncture. Our actions in the region signal to all countries where we stand on our commitment to

respecting democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Our policy in Latin America cannot be transactional.
We must insist on human rights and other democratic institutions including the rule of law. Fortifying
democratic institutions and pursuing respect for human rights is the cornerstone of United States' foreign policy

in Latin America.

It was because of these concerns that I placed a hold on the nomination of Tom Shannon. This allowed more

time for me to evaluate Mr. Shannon's record and to ask specific questions of Mr. Shannon and State
Department officials.

Two countries that represent the direction of the foreign policy commitments of the United States are Honduras

and Cuba — Honduras, having just emerged from a constitutional process that resulted in the removal of its
president and elections, and Cuba, where a dictatorial regime continues to oppress its people and violate their
most basic human rights. In these two areas, the United States must be resolute — demonstrating through action

our insistence on democracy and respect for the rule of law.

During this process I have discussed my concerns for the region with Secretary Clinton. I am grateful for her
appreciation of the unique responsibility I have to the region as a Senator from Florida. I am confident

Secretary Clinton shares my concern about a reverse of the progress of democracy and the rise of authoritarian
strongmen in Latin America. I have received sufficient commitments from Secretary Clinton that the
Administration's policy in Latin America, and specifically in Honduras and Cuba, will take a course that

promotes democratic ideals and goals.

As a result of these discussions with Secretary Clinton and other State Department officials, I am pleased to
report several concrete examples of this commitment.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766253 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

In Honduras, the U.S. will continue to normalize relations with that country's government and President-elect
Lobo. Counter-narcotics cooperation will resume, and visa procedures will be normalized.

In Cuba, the U.S. will reopen the process for non-profit organizations to apply for pro-democracy grants, the

practice of including members of the Cuban pro-democracy movement in events at the U.S. Interests Section
will be restored, Title W of the Helms Burton Act will be enforced, and the awarding of Cuba Democracy
Assistance grants will be done in a fair and transparent manner.

Ensuring our neighbors in the hemisphere recognize our commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule
of law is fundamental. Leaders in nations that seek to destabilize the region are paying close attention to U.S.
actions and the way in which we carry out our policies in Latin America. I look forward to a continuing
dialogue on hOw we can strengthen U.S. relations with the nations of the Western Hemisphere.

</span>

W A SH IN G TO N (N ew    York Times) - An independent inquiry into the attack on the United States diplomatic
mission in Libya that killed four Americans on Sept. 11 sharply criticizes the State Department for a lack of
seasoned security personnel and relying on untested local militias to safeguard the compound, Congressional

and State Department officials said Tuesday night.
    The investigation into the attacks on the diplomatic mission and C.I.A. annex that killed Ambassador J.
Christopher Stevens and three others also faulted State Department officials in Washington for ignoring
requests from officials at the American Embassy in Tripoli for more guards and safety upgrades to the

diplomatic mission.
    The panel also blamed the State Department for waiting for specific warnings of imminent attacks to act
rather than adapting security procedures and protocols to a deteriorating security environment. By this spring,
Benghazi, a hotbed of militant activity in eastern Libya, had experienced a string of assassinations and attacks,

including one on a British envoy's motorcade.
    Finally, the report also blamed two major State Department bureaus — diplomatic security and Near Eastern
affairs — for failing to coordinate and plan adequate security at the mission. The panel also determined that a
number of officials had shown poor leadership.

    In response to the panel's findings, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a letter to Congress
that she was accepting all 29 of the panel's recommendations, several of which are classified.
    Mrs. Clinton is taking specific steps to correct the problems, according to officials. They say the State
Department is asking permission from Congress to transfer $1.3 billion from funds that had been allocated for

spending in Iraq. This includes $553 million for additional Marine security guards; $130 million for diplomatic
security personnel; and $691 million for improving security at installations abroad.
    On Monday, an independent panel that was established to investigate the attack presented the report to the
State Department. The panel, called an accountability review board, is led by Thomas R. Pickering, a veteran

diplomat. It includes four other members, among them Mike Mullen, the retired admiral who served as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The board is authorized by a 1986 law intended to strengthen security at
United States diplomatic missions.

    The State Department sent a lengthy classified version of the report to Congress on Tuesday. Mr. Pickering
 and Admiral Mullen are scheduled to meet with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
House Foreign Affairs Committee in closed session on Wednesday.
    On Thursday, William J. Burns and Thomas R. Nides, both deputy secretaries of States, will testify to both

 panels. Mrs. Clinton, who is still recovering from a concussion she suffered last week after fainting while sick
 from a stomach flu, is at home this week. The head of the House panel, Representative Beam Ros-Lehtinen, a
 Florida Republican, however, has made clear that she planned to ask Mrs. Clinton to testify at a future time.

 A new doctrine of intervention?

 Washington Post Opinion
 Friday, March 30, 7:27 PM

 By Henry A. Kissinger

 Not the least significant aspect of the Arab Spring is the redefinition of heretofore prevalent principles of foreign policy.
 As the United States is withdrawing from military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan undertaken on the basis (however

 disputed) of American national security, it is reengaging in several other states in the region (albeit uncertainly) in the
 name of humanitarian intervention. Will democratic reconstruction replace national interest as the lodestar of Middle

 East policy? Is democratic reconstruction what the Arab Spring in fact represents?

 The evolving consensus is that the United States is morally obliged to align with revolutionary movements in the Middle
 East as a kind of compensation for Cold War policies — invariably described as "misguided" — in which it cooperated

 with non-democratic governments in the region for security objectives. Then, it is alleged, supporting fragile
 governments in the name of international stability generated long-term instability. Even granting that some of those

 policies were continued beyond their utility, the Cold War structure lasted 30 years and induced decisive strategic
 transformations, such as Egypt's abandonment of its alliance with the Soviet Union and the signing of the Camp David

 accords. The pattern now emerging, if it fails to establish an appropriate relationship to its proclaimed goals, risks being
 inherently unstable from inception, which could submerge the values it proclaimed.

 The Secretary's Phone Calls with Japanese, ROK, Chinese and Russian Foreign Ministers

 Monday, May 25, 2009

                                                              1

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761748 Date: 06/30/2015</span>

Purpose: To reach out to Japan, South Korea, China and Russia following the probable May 24 DPRK nuclear test.

•    A nuclear test by North Korea, if confirmed, would be a provocative act and an unequivocal violation of UNSCR
1718, blatantly disregarding the will of the international community.

•    We have remained united in the face of the DPRK's provocations, and we need to maintain this unity among the

Six-Party partners. The DPRK's message to us in advance of the test, which blamed the UNSC's "failure to apologize for
its Presidential Statement," demonstrates the degree to which the DPRK has isolated itself. Now is the right time for a

Five-Party meeting to demonstrate our unity.

•    It is essential that the UN Security Council take strong measures to clearly demonstrate that the DPRK's actions will
have consequences. The United States believes that it is essential that the Security Council issue a swift statement
condemning the DPRK's test at its initial May 25 emergency meeting. The UNSC should then quickly follow up with a

strong new Chapter 7 Resolution that includes concrete response measures.

•    [FOR TOKYO AND SEOUL] The United States remains committed to the nuclear umbrella and its obligations under
the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty.

Background:

                                                                                                                           1.4(B)

                                                                                                                           1.4(D)
                                                                                                                           B1

Call Notes:

  1 . (SBU) This is an action request, see paras 4 and 5.

  2 . (SBU) On August 14, the USG and Colombian government
  provisionally agreed ad referendum to the text of a bilateral
  Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) (septel). We expect the
  final agreement may be signed in Bogota in about a month,
  following a final review by both sides. As noted in reftels,
  the DCA would permit the United States access to several
  Colombian military bases and facilitate effective bilateral
  cooperation on security matters in Colombia. It would not/not
  authorize establishment of any U.S. bases or ports, nor would it
  result in an overall increase in the number of U.S. military
  personnel or U.S.-citizen civilian contractors in Colombia.

  3 . (SBU) On August 18, the Secretary and Colombian FM Jaime
  Bermudez met in Washington to discuss the DCA, including the
  importance of coordinating our public affairs and diplomatic
  strategies (septel to follow). There is some concern that the
  upcoming Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) summit would
  become a regional referendum on the DCA. Colombian President
  Alvaro Uribe will attend the summit provided that a full range
  of regional security matters can be discussed, not just the DCA.
  In this context, we are reaching out to selected
  UNASUR members to ask that they raise
  other regional security issues beyond the DCA.

  4 . (SBU) Action requested for Santiago, Asuncion, and
  Lima: that you find an opportunity prior to the August 28

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764535 Date: 07/31/2015</span>

 summit to raise the importance of discussing the full
 range of regional security topics during the summit, and
 not merely the DCA, with appropriate high levels of host
 government.

 5 . (SBU) Action requested for all: that Ambassadors to UNASUR
 member states deliver the attached letter from the
 Secretary to host governments in advance of the August 28
 summit.

 6 . (SBU) Begin text:

 Dear Mr./Madam Minister:

 I wanted to take a moment to write to you and your
 colleagues about the upcoming summit of the Union of South
 American Nations (UNASUR), scheduled for August 28 in
 Bariloche. UNASUR provides an important forum to address
 the issues and challenges that affect the region. The
 United States supports the formation and effective
 functioning of regional groups such as UNASUR. They
 promote stability, cohesion, and leadership on key issues,
 and ensure the best possible communication between nations.

  We are committed to being as forthcoming as possible in
  addressing concerns about this bilateral agreement with
  nations in the region, and we have endeavored to do so in
  recent weeks through a variety of mechanisms. As concerns
  or questions arise, I hope that you will feel free to
  reach out to us to seek clarification.

  The UNASUR summit provides a unique opportunity for the

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764535 Date: 07/31/2015</span>

 organization to address a range of security issues that
 affect the hemisphere, and I salute your leadership for
 deciding to discuss these matters. The security
 challenges affecting our hemisphere, and your nations in

 particular, are pressing and grave. Our firm belief is
 that a collective and collaborative approach to these
 matters is essential. It is our commitment to work with
 UNASUR nations to help address these concerns.

 Sincerely yours,

 Hillary Rodham Clinton

          EXCLUSIVE: Bill Clinton Says He Wouldn't Rule Out Arming

          Libya's Rebels

          Pm Just Speaking For Myself, Former President Says

          By SUZAN CLARICE

          April 3, 2011 —

          Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said he thinks the United States should consider arming the rebels in Libya's
          civil war.

          "It would depend ... and Imight need to know a little more, butwould be inclined to do it," Clinton told
          correspondent Bianna Golodryga today in San Diego during an exclusive interview with ABC News.

          Clinton was in San Diego for his annual Clinton Global Initiative University Meeting.

          The uprising in Libya stared in February during a wave of social and political unrest in the Middle East.
          Fighting has escalated all across the country, but the rebels have found themselves outgunned by Libyan leader
          Col. Moamrnar Gadhafi's forces, which are better equipped.

          Last month the United Nations authorized a no-fly zone over the North African nation to prevent further attacks
          on civilians from Gadhafiss troops in the air.

          Clinton  on Arming Rebels: 'I Sure Wouldn't Shut the Door to It'

          The United States backed the no-fly zone and has also authorized additional support for the anti-Gad hafi

          fighters, but key U.S. lawmakers and top officials in the government of President Barack Obanaa have said they
          are not comfortable with arming the rebels -- apparently because not enough is known about then

          But Clinton said he wouldn't completely rule out the idea of supplying arms to Libya's rebels.

           "Let me just say this. I sure wouldn't shut the door to it. I think ... we may need to know a little more," he said.

           Clinton, husband of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, stressed that he was speaking without "any official
           sanction" whatsoever.

           "I'm just speaking from myself. But I certainly wouldn't take that off the table, too," he said.

This is not a fair assessment of the position we have taken. We have more than tripled to level of assistance from what

was proposed in the last Administration and have expressed flexibility about how to structure it. Jeff has consistently
been pushing the Palauns to press for more. Kurt reached out to him per your instruction and we will get you a
complete memo.

         Wed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the US against a resolution calling

for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other). Even the two other states in free association with the US.
did not support the US position. Important officials in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in U.S.

assistance that Alcy Frelick has insisted on but Pres. Toribiong decided to stick with the US. The proposal to cut the small
amount of assistance that Palau is receiving is ironic in light of the substantial increase in assistance pledged to the two

other freely associated states just a few years ago. It is also misinformed and misguided.

LONDON (Reuters) - The latest draft resolution on Libya under discussion at the United Nations calls for "all
necessary measures short of an occupation force" to protect civilians under threat of attack, Britain said on

Thursday.

   Foreign Secretary William Hague said the latest draft of the resolution to be discussed at the U.N. Security

Council in New York on Thursday followed extensive consultations with Lebanon, France, the United States
and others.

   He said there was no longer anything holding the United States back from supporting a no-fly zone over
Libya, where leader Muammar Gaddafi's troops are advancing on rebels.

Loose lips and the Obama national security ship

Posted at 7:09 pm by: By CNN's Adam Levine

By Adam Levine, with reporting from Pam Benson and Ann Colwell

The level of detail spilling out through media reports about crucial national security operations is raising the question of

whether President Barack Obama's administration can keep a secret — or in some cases even wants to.

In just the past week, two tell-all articles about Obama's leadership as commander-in-chief have been published,
dripping with insider details about his sleeves-rolled-up involvement in choosing terrorist targets for drone strikes and

revelations about his amped-up cyber war on Iran.

Each article notes the reporters spoke to "current and former" American officials and presidential advisers, as well as
sources from other countries.

'This is unbelievable ... absolutely stunning," a former senior intelligence official said about the level of detail contained

in the cyberattack story.

The official noted that the article cited participants in sensitive White House meetings who then told the reporter about
top secret discussions. The article "talks about President Obama giving direction for a cyberweapons attack during a

time of peace against a United Nations member state."

The article follows on the heels of what many considered dangerous leaking of details about a mole who helped foil a
plot by al Qaeda in Yemen. The revelations of the British national threatened what was described at the time as an

ongoing operation.

"The leak really did endanger sources and methods," Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California and chair of the Intelligence
Committee, told Fox News.

The Yemen plot had many intelligence and national security officials flummoxed and angered by its public

airing. Despite that, a senior administration official then briefed network counterterrorism analysts, including CNN's
Frances Townsend, about parts of the operation.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05794647 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

But such briefings are an "obligation" for the administration once a story like the Yemen plot is publicized, insisted
National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor.

"The reason that we brief former counterterrorism officials is because they are extremely conscientious about working

with us about what can and cannot be said or disclosed," Vietor told Security Clearance. "They understand that there is
an obligation for the U.S. to be transparent with American people about potential threats but will work with us to

protect operational equities because they've walked in our shoes."

Subsequently, the intelligence committee initiated a review of its agencies to assess the leak. The FBI launched an
investigation as well.

Perhaps the highest profile intelligence coupe for the administration, the killing of Osama bin Laden, was followed

almost immediately by criticism of how much detail was leaking out. Then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates
complained that after officials agreed in the Situation Room not to reveal operational details, it was mere hours before

that agreement was broken.

"The leaks that followed the successful bin Laden mission led to the arrest of Pakistanis and put in danger the mission's
heroes and their families," Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said in an interview on CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront."

Questions were raised about why details of documents and other articles that were seized during the raid were

discussed even before the intelligence community had time to review what they were holding.

Leon Panetta, who at the time was the director of the CIA and is now the defense secretary, penned a letter to CIA staff
warning against loose lips.

In the letter, obtained by CNN, Panetta wrote that the operation, "led to an unprecedented amount of very sensitive -

in fact, classified — information making its way into the press."

"Disclosure of classified information to anyone not cleared for it — reporters, friends, colleagues in the private sector or
other agencies, former agency officers — does tremendous damage to our work. At worst, leaks endanger lives," the

letter said.

In the latest case, the White House denied it was orchestrating the leak. Asked Friday if the Times' story detailing the
cyberattack on Iran was an "authorized leak," White House spokesman Josh Earnest disagreed "in the strongest possible

terms."

'That information is classified for a reason. Publicizing it would pose a threat to our national security," Earnest told
reporters.

But the White House has tried to be more open about what have been secretive programs. The president himself

became the first administration official to acknowledge U.S. drones were conducting attacks in Pakistan when he made a
comment to a supporter in an online chat, even though officials through all the years of the program had never said

publicly they were being conducted.

Then, in April, the president's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, John Brennan, publicly blew the
cover off the drone program, saying in a speech that "yes, in full accordance with the law — and in order to prevent

terrorist attacks on the United States and to save American lives — the United States government conducts targeted
strikes against specific al Qaeda terrorists, sometimes using remotely piloted aircraft, often referred to publicly as

drones."

But that speech, Vietor told CNN's Security Clearance last month, was carefully considered for how revealing it could be.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05794647 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

"I'm not going to get into internal deliberations, but as a general matter we obviously push to be as transparent as we

can while being mindful of our national security equities," Vietor said.

   Re: Syria, Turkey, Israel, Iran

   SOURCE: Sources with access to the highest levels of the Governments and institutions

   discussed below. This includes political parties and regional intelligence and security services.

           1. According to an individual with access to the highest levels of major European

   governments, the intelligence services of these countries are reporting to their principals that the

   commanders of the Israeli military and intelligence community believe that the civil war in

   Syria is spreading to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey . These

   European officials are concerned that the ongoing conflict in Syria will lead to uprisings in these
   countries that will bring increasingly conservative Islamic regimes into power, replacing

   existing secular or moderate regimes. This individual adds that, Israeli security officials believe

   that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that these developments will leave them

   vulnerable, with only enemies on their borders.

           2.  In private conversations senior Israeli Intelligence and Military commaders state to

   their European associates that they have long viewed the regime of Syrian President Bashar al

   Assad, while hostile, as a known quantity and a buffer between Israel and the more militant

   Muslim countries, a situation that is threatened by the growing successs of the rebel forces of the
   Free Syria Army (FSA). This source is convinced that these Israeli leaders are now drawing up

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05795338 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

   contingency plans to deal with a regional structure where the new revolutionary regimes that take
   over the various countries will be controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood and possibly more

   problematic groups such as al Qa'ida, which doesn't bode well for the Israelis.

           3. At the same time, looking at the tensions between Israel and Iran as part of the overall
   situation in the region, these European heads of state are receiving reporting indicating that if

   Israel were to attack the Iranian nuclear facilities at this time it would only exacerbate relations

   with their neighbors. In addition, such an attack may lead to further deterioration in the world

   economy, which would in turn be blamed on Israel. These sources believe that such an attack

   would also unite the Iranian population against the United States and strengthen their ties to the
   Mullahs, rather than weaken them. These particular individuals fear that this in turn would

   accelerate Iranian efforts at building a nuclear arsenal, seeking additional support from their

    contacts in Russia and China.

           4.  According to a source with direct access, Turkish Army commanders have stated in

    private discussions with the highest levels of their Government that an Israeli attack on Iran will

    surely start a regional war "before the first Israel air-strike sortie has returned to base". Turkish

    intelligence estimates, supported by their liaison contacts in Western European intelligence
    services, advise that thousands of missiles and rockets would fall on Israel fired from Iran,

    Lebanon, Syria, and Gaza.

            5. (Source Comment: The Turkish Army estimates that Syria and Lebanon Hezbollah
    forces have access to over 200,000 surface to surface rockets and missiles. Their military

    analysts also believe that an assault from such a force would overwhelm Israel's defenses.)

            6. According to these individuals, the European intelligence sources are also advising
    their heads of state that international economic sanctions are truly hurting the Iranian economy

    and have begun to foster frustration among the Iranian people. Sources in Tehran report that this

    hostility is increasingly aimed at the ruling party. These indivdivals also advise that an Israeli

    attack against Iran would immediately serve to undermine this situation, turning the populaton
    against Israel, the United States, and Western Europe in support of their rulers, both Islamic and

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05795338 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

   Secular. In this regard, these European security leaders regularly site the words of Prime

   Minister Netanyahu: "Iran in particular is susceptible to economic pressure. The oil-exporting

   Islamic republic is virtually a single-crop economy, and imposition of a tight blockade against

   Iranian oil sales will undoubtedly induce in Teheran a prompt revaluation of the utility of even

   indirect terrorist tactics."

           7. One particular source states that the British and French Intelligence services believe

   that their Israeli counterparts are convinced that there is a positive side to the civil war in Syria;

   if the Assad regime topples, Iran would lose its only ally in the Middle East and would be
   isolated. At the same time, the fall of the House of Assad could well ignite a sectarian war

   between the Shiites and the majority Sunnis of the region drawing in Iran, which, in the view of

   Israeli commaders would not be a bad thing for Israel and its Western allies. In the opinion of

   this individual, such a scenario would distract and might obstruct Iran from its nuclear activities
   for a good deal of time. In addition, certain senior Israeli intelligence analysts believe that this

   turn of events may   even prove to be a factor in the eventual fall of the current government of

   Iran.

           8.  (Source Comment: In the opinion of this particularly sensitive source, after
   discussions with Israeli contacts, if you consider Israel's position at this juncture, with all that is

   ongoing in the region, what position would you take? At present, considering that Israel is not

    prepared for an all out war with Iran, they may well continue to threaten action, giving the

   impression they are serious about pursuing aggresive Iranian anti-nuclear efforts. One way to do
    that is to update weapon systems; secure an air base in Saudi Arabia that would suggest a staging

    ground for an eventual attack, then "leak" the word to the media that their are eminent plans to

    carry out a bombing raid and do everything possible to persuade the world they mean business.)

            9. At the same time, a separate sensitive source added that the European security services

    are concerned that this brinksmanship could lead to missteps that could, in turn, lead to a

    regional war. In this regard these European services are staying in close contact with their Israeli

    counterparts as they attempt to manipulate events while avoiding a general conflict at this time.
    This individual stated that a senior Israeli military commander described the current situation

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05795338 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

   from the Israeli perspective by quoting Sun Tzu wrote in THE ART OF WAR: "He will win who

   knows when to fight and when not to fight."

 Purpose:   To reach out to Japan, South Korea, China and Russia following the
 probable May 24 DPRK nuclear test.

     • A nuclear test by North Korea, if confirmed, would be a provocative act and
        an unequivocal violation of UNSCR 1718, blatantly disregarding the will of

        the international community.

     •  We have remained united in the face of the DPRK's provocations, and we
        need to maintain this unity among the Six-Party partners. The DPRK's

        message to us in advance of the test, which blamed the UNSC's "failure to
        apologize for its Presidential Statement," demonstrates the degree to which
        the DPRK has isolated itself. Now is the right time for a Five-Party meeting
        to demonstrate our unity.

     • It is essential that the UN Security Council take strong measures to clearly
        demonstrate that the DPRK's actions will have consequences. The United
        States believes that it is essential that the Security Council issue a swift

        statement condemning the DPRK's test at its initial May 25 emergency
        meeting. The UNSC should then quickly follow up with a strong new
        Chapter 7 Resolution that includes concrete response measures.

        [FOR TOKYO AND SEOUL] The United States remains committed to the
        nuclear umbrella and its obligations under the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual
        Cooperation and Security and the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty.

HAITI (Special Case)

Haiti has had a weak government since widespread violence and political instability led to the resignation of the
president in 2004. National elections in 2006 elected a president and a Parliament that replaced an appointed
interim government, but the effectiveness of state institutions remained severely limited. Civil unrest in April

2008 left the country without a government for five months. The Government of Haiti's ability to provide basic
services and security for citizens, and to control rampant crime in the capital, Port-au-Prince, continues to be
compromised by limited resources, an untrained and poorly equipped police force, entrenched government
corruption, and perennially weak government institutions.

The UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) continued to maintain more than 6,950 troops and 1,900
police throughout the country to provide security. Haiti remains a Special Case for the fourth consecutive year

as the new government formed in September 2008 has not yet been able to address the significant challenges
facing the country, including human trafficking. The U.S. government, however, notes the progress of Haiti's
government, and urges the Government of Haiti to take immediate action to address its serious trafficking-in-
persons problems. The following background and recommendations are provided to guide government officials.

Scope and Magnitude: Haiti is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children
trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation. Haitian women, men, and children are
trafficked into the Dominican Republic, The Bahamas, the United States, Europe, Canada, and Jamaica for

exploitation in domestic service, agriculture, and construction. Trafficked Dominican women and girls are
forced into prostitution. Some may be patronized by UN peacekeepers in Haiti, although MINUSTAH is
implementing programs among its personnel to suppress this practice. Several NGOs noted a sharp increase in

the number of Haitian children trafficked for sex and labor to the Dominican Republic and The Bahamas during
2008.

The majority of trafficking cases are found among the estimated 90,000 to 300,000 restaveks in Haiti, and the

3,000 additional restaveks who are trafficked to the Dominican Republic. Poor, mostly rural families send their
children to cities to live with relatively wealthier "host" families, whom they expect to provide the children with
food, shelter, and an education in exchange for domestic work. While some restaveks are cared for and sent to

school, most of these children are subjected to involuntary domestic servitude. These restaveks, 65 percent of
whom are girls between the ages of six and 14, work excessive hours, receive no schooling or payment and are
often physically and sexually abused. Haitian labor laws require employers to pay domestic workers over the
age of 15, so many host families dismiss restaveks before they reach that age. Dismissed and runaway restaveks

make up a significant proportion of the large population of street children, who frequently are forced to work in
prostitution or street crime by violent criminal gangs. Women and girls from the Dominican Republic are
trafficked into Haiti for commercial sexual exploitation. Some of the Haitians who voluntarily migrate to the

Dominican Republic, The Bahamas, the United States, and other Caribbean nations, subsequently face
conditions of forced labor on sugar-cane plantations, and in agriculture and construction.

Government Efforts:    Haitian officials recognize that human trafficking is a serious problem in the country,

including the exploitation of restavek children as domestic servants. As a policy matter, however, the national
police child protection unit, the Brigade for the Protection of Minors (BPM), does not pursue restavek
trafficking cases because there is no statutory penalty against the practice. Haitian law also does not specifically

                                                       321

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763961 Date: 07/31/2015</span>

prohibit trafficking in persons, which limits its ability to punish traffickers and protect victims. It did shut down

a number of unregistered orphanages whose residents were believed to be vulnerable to trafficking.

The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor (MAST) should make every effort to complete its revision of and

resubmit to Parliament its comprehensive anti-trafficking bill; Parliament should consider it, and then pass a law
prohibiting all forms of human trafficking. Until then, authorities could begin to enforce existing criminal
statutes penalizing slavery, kidnapping, forced prostitution and forced labor to prosecute trafficking offenses.

Judges, police, and prosecutors throughout the country need additional anti-trafficking training before they can
effectively prosecute and punish trafficking offenders. Lacking its own resources, the government cooperates

with numerous NGOs to assist victims and to train officials about trafficking issues. Haitian immigration
officers working with MINUSTAH proactively identified potential child trafficking victims at airports and the
border with the Dominican Republic.

The Office of National Identification, with technical assistance from the Organization of American States and
the Government of Canada, began to provide national identity cards to persons who reached the legal voting age

since the last election. It continued to provide birth certificates to citizens who had not previously been issued
official identity documents. The government does not follow systematic victim identification procedures,
though Haitian authorities work closely with NGOs to refer identified victims -- primarily children -- and

coordinate protective services as needed. Shelter services for adult trafficking victims do not exist, and the
government should make every effort to open or support facilities which could provide men and women with
appropriate assistance.

Hi Cheryl,

The Secretary asked me to send her, through you, an informal paper that she could share with President Clinton on the
restavek problem. I was in Africa and then out of pocket much of last week, but I wanted to make sure that you have it

before you go to Haiti.

If I don't see you before then, have a great trip!

      Subj: Change of Government in Kyrgyzstan

      I have worked in the Kyrgyz Republic continuously since 1991

                  I became acquainted with each of the three Kyrgyz leaders from about that
      time, first meeting Askar Akayev in 1990 in Moscow, Kurmanbek Bakiyev in Djalalabad
      in 1993, and Roza Otunbayeva in Bishkek in 1992. I have had extended dealings with
      each of them on many different matters, largely inside Kyrgyzstan, although I first dealt
      extensively with Otunbayeva when she served as Kyrgyz ambassador in the United

      States.

      Assessment of Otunbayeva: The opposition forces selected Otunbayeva for several
      reasons: (i) among them she is the only figure who commands recognition and respect
      abroad; (ii) in the eyes of the Kyrgyz people she is closely associated with the Kyrgyz

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774789 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

       Tulip Revolution of 2005, yet she alone among the leaders of that revolution upheld its
       idealism, openly castigated Bakiyev and others for their corruption and failure to follow
      through on promises, and personally avoided corruption and graft; and (iii) she lacks a
       strong domestic power base and therefore is seen as less of a threat to the alternative

       candidates. Based on these factors, several of the opposition leaders tell me a quick
       consensus was reached that Otunbayeva should be the provisional leader and the "face to
       the world" of the new revolution.

       Otunbayeva, who is 59, launched her career in the diplomatic service, obtaining the
       position of foreign minister of the Kyrgyz SSR at a precocious age. She served in the

       Soviet Foreign Ministry and caught the eye of Eduard Shevardnadze, who appointed her
       as a vice minister—an unprecedented accomplishment for a Central Asian and for a
       woman then in her late 30s. Shevardnadze told me in 2002 that he had viewed
       Otunbayeva as a person of extraordinary skills, well qualified to succeed him as Soviet
       foreign minister. He noted her ability quickly to grasp complex problems and to propose
       novel and interesting solutions. He called her a "natural diplomat" with an instinctive

       tendency to reconcile, but also with a clear grasp of policy objectives and a methodical
       approach to their accomplishment. My own experience in dealing with Otunbayeva
       confirms these observations. She has a measure of idealism that often guides her policy
       orientation, but she is instinctively pragmatic in her approach.

       Otunbayeva defies categorization in terms of political philosophy.    Her political parties,

       firstAta-Jurt ("Fatherland"), then the Social Democrats, are often portrayed as "leftists"
       on the political scale in Kyrgyzstan, but the party orients itself to continental European
       social democrats and to the British Labour Party (with which Otunbayeva has solid
       connections, including with Tony Blair). While schooled in basic concepts of Marxism-
       Leninism, which occasionally appear in conversation (though often as not in a joking
       way), her politics is fundamentally one of pragmatic engagement. She advocates

       maintenance of the republic's Soviet era social net and pays particular attention to health
       and education issues. She was a vigorous advocate for and supporter of the American
       University in Bishkek and was repeatedly identified for board membership—she declined
       one offer saying that her role as an opposition leader would probably complicate the
       university's relations with the government. As ambassador, Otunbayeva went to bat
       aggressively for foreign investors, helped them secure concessions, and advocated for

       them against government red tape. I am unaware of any instance in which she ever
       sought personal gain or advancement in connection with these deals, however. She is
       very unusual among Kyrgyz political figures in her rejection of rent-seeking and her loud
       denunciation of political figures who use their office for personal gain. Indeed, this
       aspect of her personality has won her some respect in the public, but general disdain
       among the political class, who frequently disparage her as "unrealistic."

       Otunbayeva served extended periods in Washington and London as the Kyrgyz
       ambassador. She has a fluent and subtle command of the English language, and a
       broadly positive view of the United States and the United Kingdom. Of the three Kyrgyz
       leaders to date, she is clearly the one with the deepest understanding of American culture
       and the American political environment and the one with the most instinctively pro-

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774789 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

      American leanings.

                                                                                                              1.4(D)
                                                                                                               B1
      Otunbayeva believes that for cultural, commercial and security reasons, a stable
      relationship between Bishkek and Moscow is a matter of primary concern.

      Her Position within the New Government. Opposition leaders with whom I have spoken
      expect that Bakiyev will resign, that the opposition will dissolve parliament and form a

      new interim government with Otunbayeva as its leader and that new elections will then
      soon be called first for president and then for a new parliament. Many of the opposition
      figures doubt that Otunbayeva can be a successful candidate for president especially
      given her weak performance in prior elections to parliament. Tekebayev is more broadly
      expected to emerge as their nominee. However, there is recognition that, Otunbayeva
      may, if she skillfully manages the transition period, develop the necessary popular basis

      and emerge as leader. It is stressed that her prospects increase as relations with foreign
      powers are seen as problematic, since she alone among the opposition figures is viewed
      as having the stature and skills necessary to cope with difficult foreign affairs problems.

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774789 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

      Opposition Relations With Bishkek Embassy. Opposition leaders express a broadly
      positive view of U.S. ambassador Tatiana Gfoeller.

                                                                                                                    1.4(D)
                                                                                                                    B1

      One other fact is very important here: Otunbayeva herself is a professional diplomat.

      She will strongly prefer to address these issues through diplomatic dialogue with other
      professional diplomats.
      	                                               All of this suggests to me the necessity for
      the State Department to assert itself and take the lead in developing relations with the
      new government.

Preparing this to share with my Board; welcome your edits, additions, corrections. Thanks

Observations

    1.  There is a considerable change in Indonesian attitudes toward the United States. The latest Pew Global Polls
        indicate a 73%approval level; the last time it was nearly this level was only in the wake of the generous help

        provided after the Tsunami disaster. Higher education officials warmly welcomed our trip and, more importantly,
        are eager to increase student flows to America and institutional partnerships between U.S. and Indonesian
        universities. The Director General for Higher Education (DGHE) has been given a special budget to promote this,
        seven leading schools have been given special budgets by DGHE to explore partnerships, and the Ministry will
        support a delegation of leading Indonesian educators and Rectors to visit the U.S. sometime in late fall/early
        winter.
    2. The Delegation represented over 30 colleges and universities arrived only 9 days after the terrorist bombing of

        two hotels in Jakarta, which meant our Indonesian hosts deeply appreciated the show of solidarity we made by
        coming. During our visit, the White House announced that President Obama would come to Jakarta in
        November. The U.S. Ambassador arranged for the entire Country Team to brief us on our first day; we saw him
        and his senior staff three more times during the week for substantive meetings, and he attended the farewell
        dinner given by the Minister of Education. We were also scheduled to be received by President Susilo Bambang
        Yudhoyono (SBY), who had to cancel at the last minute due to the onset of flu. Earlier in the week we were

        hosted by his Spokesman.
    3.  Nearly every Indonesian senior official with whom we met had been educated in the United States. But many of
        the officials just below that level had not had this chance. Some characterized this cohort as a lost generation
        andthe senior officials all spoke about providingopportunities for this groupnow(througha "re-charging" program
        that the Government will fund) for short termstudy visits and about making sure that the next generation will now
        have the chances that the most senior group once did to come to America for especially graduate education.

    4. Indonesia, the 4thmost populous country inthe world, is the sixteenth-leadingcountry of originfor students
        coming to the U.S.; number 15 is Hong Kong (8200 students). A little more than 7600 Indonesians are currently
        enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities. This is approximately half the number that were enrolled a decade
        ago. The decline began in the wake of the Asian Economic Crisis of 1997 and accelerated after 2001 when there
        were substantial visa issues and problems —coupled to a growing perception by Indonesians that America was an
        unfriendly and not very welcoming country, especially for Muslims. At the same time, major campaigns were

        launched by the governments of Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, China, Germany and the Netherlands to recruit
        Indonesian students; today there are over 20,000 Indonesians studying in Australia alone. The appeal of these
        countries also stems fromthe relative ease of applying to non-US higher education institutions and the willingness
        to take students with low levels of English.

                                                            77

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763378 Date: 07/31/2015</span>

    5.  We did not hear a single visa complaint during our meetings and public forum. The U.S. embassy is on track to
        issue a record number this year and now estimates that 80 percent of all student visa applications are being
        granted.

    6. The market for study abroad is probably very large. A recent poll by the Kompas newspaper found that 76.3% of
        Indonesian students would prefer to go abroad for at least one degree. There are over 4.5 million final-year high
        school students and 4.3 million currently enrolled in Indonesian universities, represent about a 17%enrollment
        rate about the college-age cohort. The Government wants to raise this to 25% by 2011. This means adding over
        400,000 new university students each year and doubling the size of the nation's entire teaching faculty. There are
        approximately 154,000 faculty, but only 7% have any form of advance degrees and fewer than 5,000 have a

        PhD. Capacity and quality challenges are huge.
    7. We were repeatedly told that Higher Education is a top national priority and that the Government would like a
        minimuminternational student enrollment of 5%in order to continue Indonesia's embrace of globalization nd
        better prepare their students for work in a globalized world. A Higher Education Reformeffort is just getting
        underway, with initial emphasis on improving the quality and government support for science and
        technology. There are over 2800 institutions of higher education, but only 86 public universities and

        polytechnics. Enrollment in the public schools is about 1 million versus 3.4 million in private higher
        education. The Government is coming to terms with how best to regulate the private sector; a recently-passed
        lawin Parliament calls for all private institutions to be brought under greater government control and oversight
        over the next 6 years. All boards of trustees will by then have to report on their activities to a government
        agency.
    8. A very small number of Americans, 132 in 2006-2007, study abroad for credit and most do so on short term,
        faculty-led study visits. The highest this number has ever been was only 215 (in 1994-1995). Most of the

        delegation did not immediately see howthey could send their students here for semester or year-long programs,
        but an increasing number of courses are being taught in English at some leading universities. Almost all felt that
        only Gadjah Made University in Yogyakarta was well set up to receive U.S. students and able to offer a significant
        number of courses for themto take. Other institutions (especially in Bogor and possibly Bandung) offer promising
        sites for field research in agriculture, environmental studies ,and marine science. Bali will remain an important
        site for those in programs associated with the humanities and cultural studies.
    9.  Education Ministry officials stressed their desire to move rapidly to build on the momentumof this visit, create new

        institutional partnerships, and expand educational programs under the official US-Indonesia Bilateral Partnership
        proposed by President SBY (who went to the US six times during the course of his education and is a graduate of
        Webster university) and endorsed by Secretary of State Clinton.

Hillary Clinton Pledges to 'Banish Sexual Violence'
Originally posted Friday August 21, 2009 12:30 PM EDT

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may be taking some well-earned R&amp;R in Bermuda this week, but last week, the former
First Lady and U.S. Senator wrapped up a grueling seven-nation diplomatic mission to Africa.

While much was made back home about her snapping at a Congolese student who asked her about Bill Clinton's
thoughts on a trade issue ("My husband is not the secretary of state, I am," she retorted), the emotional heart of her

tour was also her most dangerous stop —in Goma, inside the war zone in eastern Congo, where she tearfully met rape
victims on Aug. 11.In this exclusive Op-Ed piece for PEOPLE.com    , Secretary Clinton shares what she learned on her visit -

and what she will do about it.

What I Saw in Goma

By Hillary RodhamClinton

In 11 days of travel across Africa, I saw humanity at its worst —and at its best. In Goma last week, I saw both.

The Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma, a
provincial capital in the eastern Congo. The camp is now home to 18,000 people seeking refuge from a cycle of violent
conflict that has left 5.4 million dead since 1998. Chased from their homes and villages by armed rebels and informal

militias, these men, women and children walked for miles with little food or water until they reached this relatively safe
haven.

                                                              ---,

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764951 Date: 07/31/2015</span>

Now they live in tents, one next to the other, row after row, some clinging to life, others hanging on to whatever
glimmer of hope remains in a region plagued by years of brutality. Many of these people have been robbed of their

homes, possessions, families and, worst of all, their dignity.

Women and girls in particular have been victimized on an unimaginable scale, as sexual and gender-based violence has

become a tactic of war and has reached epidemic proportions. Some 1,100 rapes are reported each month, with an
average of 36 women and girls raped every day.

I visited a hospital run by the organization Heal Africa and met a woman who told me that she was eight months'
pregnant when she was attacked. She was at home when a group of men broke in. They took her husband and two of
their children and shot them in the front yard, before returning into the house to shoot her other two children. Then

they beat and gang-raped her and left her for dead. But she wasn't dead. She fought for life and her neighbors managed
to get her to the hospital —85 kilometers away.

I came to Goma to send a clear message: The United States condemns these attacks and all those who commit them and
abet them. They are crimes against humanity.

These acts don't just harma single individual, or a single family, or village, or group. They shred the fabric that weaves us
together as human beings. Such atrocities have no place in any society. This truly is humanity at its worst.

But there is reason to hope. We have seen survivors summon the courage to rebuild their lives and their communities.
We have seen civic leaders and organizations come together to combat this appalling scourge. And we have seen health

care workers sacrifice comfortable careers so they can treat the wounded

.In Goma, I met doctors and advocates who work every day to repair the broken bodies and spirits of women who have

been raped, often by gangs, and often in such brutal fashion that they can no longer bear children, or walk or work.
Caregivers like Lyn Lusi, who founded Heal Africa in Goma, and Dr. Denis Mukwege, who founded the Panzi hospital in
Bukavu, represent humanity at its best.

The United States will stand with these brave people. This week I announced more than $17 million in new funding to
prevent and respond to gender and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We will provide medical care,

counseling, economic assistance and legal support. We will dedicate nearly $3 million to recruit and train police officers
to protect women and girls and to investigate sexual violence. We will send technology experts to help women and
front-line workers report abuse using photographs and video and share information on treatment and legal options. And

we will deploy a team of civilian experts, medical personnel and military engineers to assess how we can further assist
survivors of sexual violence.

While I was in the DRC, I had very frank discussions about sexual violence with President Kabila. I stressed that the
perpetrators of these crimes, no matter who they are, must be prosecuted and punished. This is particularly important

when they are in positions of authority, including members of the Congolese military, who have been allowed to commit
these crimes with impunity.

Our commitment to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence did not begin with my visit to Goma, and it will not
end with my departure.

We are redoubling our efforts to address the fundamental cause of this violence: the fighting that goes on and on in the
eastern Congo. We will be taking additional steps at the United Nations and in concert with other nations to bring an
end to this conflict.

There is an old Congolese proverb that says, "No matter how long the night, the day is sure to come." The day must

come when the women of the eastern Congo can walk freely again, to tend their fields, play with their children and
collect firewood and water without fear. They live in a region of unrivaled natural beauty and rich resources. They are

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764951 Date: 07/31/2015</span>

strong and resilient. They could, if given the opportunity, drive economic and social progress that would make their
country both peaceful and prosperous.

Working together, we will banish sexual violence into the dark past, where it belongs, and help the Congolese people

seize the opportunities of a new day.

 Obama set to unveil plan on global food security

 Christopher Doering, Reuters

 Date: 9/22/09

 (c) 2009 Reuters

 The Obama administration will unveil its long-awaited global food security plan during the next few days with the

United States expected to focus on helping farmers in poor countries feed themselves through better productivity,
research and infrastructure.

 Leaders of the G8 countries pledged $20 billion in July to impoverished farmers to tackle chronic hunger. Instead of

counting on food donations,

        <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764780 Date: 07/31/2015</span>

 they want to focus on helping small farmers feed themselves and neighbors through research such as creating seeds

better suited to local conditions, boosting production and infrastructure to get crops to market.

 The issue will take center stage when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon discuss
food security on

Saturday in
 New York.

 A U.S. official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, confirmed the Obama administration plans to unveil a

food security plan
at or

 around the time of the Saturday food security event.

 Sen. Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican, told reporters at a hunger conference that according to notes from Secretary
Clinton, she will discuss "a multi-sectoral approach" promoting the development of infrastructure, education and

research along with increasing farming productivity for
local

 producers.

 The Obama administration is "on the right track," said Lugar, who has introduced a bill with similar food aid reform
measures. However, he was

not
 optimistic that his plan, awaiting vote in the full Senate, would move forward this year.

 "Until voters and politicians are motivated, very little can often be accomplished," he said.

 More than 1 billion people will be chronically hungry this year, the United Nations' World Food Program estimates, up

from 963 million in

        <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764780 Date: 07/31/2015</span>

2008 when

 food prices spiked, causing hoarding and riots over food in some nations.

 Much of the blame on the failure to combat global hunger is because
U.S. politicians, business leaders and others have not made it a

priority, said
 Dan Glickman, former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture who is vice chairman

of the Friends of the World Food Program.

 Representative Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, said reaction to
the Obama administration's plan will be crucial to determine if the

United
 States is committed to trying something new.

 "What we don't have is political will," said McGovern. "Leadership is

going to have to come from the White House."

        Wed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the U.S against a
        resolution calling for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other). Even the two
        other states in free association with the US. did not support the US position. important officials

        in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in.U.S. assistance that Alcy Frelick has
        insisted on but Pres. Toribiong decided to stick with the US. The proposal to cut the small

        amount of assistance that Palau is receiving is ironic in light of the substantial increase in
        assistance pledged to the two other freely associated states just a few years ago. It is also
        misinformed and    misguided.

Subj: Change of Government in Kyrgyzstan

I have worked in the Kyrgyz Republic continuously since 1991      	                             I became

acquainted with each of the three Kyrgyz leaders from about that time, first meeting Askar Akayev in 1990 in
Moscow, Kurmanbek Bakiyev in Djalalabad in 1993, and Roza Otunbayeva in Bishkek in 1992.              Ihave had
extended dealings with each of them on many different matters, largely inside Kyrgyzstan, although I first dealt

extensively with Otunbayeva when she served as Kyrgyz ambassador in the United States.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768172 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

Assessment of Otunbayeva: The opposition forces selected Otunbayeva for several reasons: (i) among them she
is the only figure who commands recognition and respect abroad; (ii) in the eyes of the Kyrgyz people she is
closely associated with the Kyrgyz Tulip Revolution of 2005, yet she alone among the leaders of that revolution

upheld its idealism, openly castigated Bakiyev and others for their corruption and failure to follow through on
promises, and personally avoided corruption and graft; and (iii) she lacks a strong domestic power base and
therefore is seen as less of a threat to the alternative candidates. Based on these factors, several of the
opposition leaders tell me a quick consensus was reached that Otunbayeva should be the provisional leader and
the "face to the world" of the new revolution.

Otunbayeva, who is 59, launched her career in the diplomatic service, obtaining the position of foreign minister
of the Kyrgyz SSR at a precocious age. She served in the Soviet Foreign Ministry and caught the eye of Eduard
Shevardnadze, who appointed her as a vice minister--an unprecedented accomplishment for a Central Asian
and for a woman then in her late 30s. Shevardnadze told me in 2002 that he had viewed Otunbayeva as a

person of extraordinary skills, well qualified to succeed him as Soviet foreign minister. He noted her ability
quickly to grasp complex problems and to propose novel and interesting solutions. He called her a "natural
diplomat" with an instinctive tendency to reconcile, but also with a clear grasp of policy objectives and a
methodical approach to their accomplishment. My own experience in dealing with Otunbayeva confirms these
observations. She has a measure of idealism that often guides her policy orientation, but she is instinctively
pragmatic in her approach.

Otunbayeva defies categorization in terms of political philosophy. Her political parties, first Ata-Jurt
("Fatherland"), then the Social Democrats, are often portrayed as "leftists" on the political scale in Kyrgyzstan,
but the party orients itself to continental European social democrats and to the British Labour Party (with which
Otunbayeva has solid connections, including with Tony Blair). While schooled in basic concepts of Marxism-
Leninism, which occasionally appear in conversation    (though often as not in a joking way), her politicsis

fundamentally one of pragmatic engagement. She advocates maintenance of the republic's Soviet era social net
and pays particular attention to health and education issues. She was a vigorous advocate for and supporter of
the American University in Bishkek and was repeatedly identified for board membership—she declined one
offer saying that her role as an opposition leader would probably complicate the university's relations with the
government. As ambassador, Otunbayeva went to bat aggressively for foreign investors, helped them secure
concessions, and advocated for them against government red tape. I am unaware of any instance in which she

ever sought personal gain or advancement in connection with these deals, however. She is very unusual among
Kyrgyz political figures in her rejection of rent-seeking and her loud denunciation of political figures who use
their office for personal gain. Indeed, this aspect of her personality has won her some respect in the public, but
general disdain among the political class, who frequently disparage her as "unrealistic."

Otunbayeva served extended periods in 'Washington and London as the Kyrgyz ambassador. She has a fluent

and subtle command of the English language, and a broadly positive view of the United States and the United
Kingdom. Of the three Kyrgyz leaders to date, she is clearly the one with the deepest understanding of
American   culture and the American political environment and the one with the most instinctively pro-American
leanings.                                                                                                            1.4(D)
                                                                                                                     B1

Otunbayeva believes that for cultural, commercial and security reasons, a stable relationship between Bishkek
and Moscow is a matter of primary concern.

Her Position within the New Government. Opposition leaders with whom I have spoken expect that Bakiyev
will resign, that the opposition will dissolve parliament and form a new interim government with Otunbayeva as
its leader and that new elections will then soon be called first for president and then for a new parliament. Many

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768172 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

of the opposition figures doubt that Otunbayeva can be a successful candidate for president especially given her
weak performance in prior elections to parliament. Tekebayev is more broadly expected to emerge as their
nominee. However, there is recognition that, Otunbayeva may, if she skillfully manages the transition period,
develop the necessary popular basis and emerge as leader. It is stressed that her prospects increase as relations
                                                                                                                  1.4(D)
with foreign powers are seen as problematic, since she alone among the opposition figures is viewed as having B1
the stature and skills necessary to cope with difficult foreign affairs problems.

ambassador Tatiana Gfoeller.

                                                                                                                           1.4(D)
                                                                                                                           B1

One other fact is very important here: Otunbayeva herself is a professional diplomat. She will strongly prefer

to address these issues through diplomatic dialogue with other professional diplomats.

me the necessity for the State Department to assert itself and take the lead in developing relations with the new

government.

Re: The deal between MB &amp; SCAF
</span>

SOURCE: Sources with access to the highest levels of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, The Supreme Council of the
Armed Forces, and Western Intelligence and security services.
         1. On the evening of June 23, 2012, senior officials attached to the Guidance committee of the Muslim
Brotherhood (MB) were called to an emergency, secret meeting with officers of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces

(SCAF). During this session the MB was informed that on the following day Egypt's Electoral Commission would
announce the victory of Mohammed Morsi, the MB/Freedom and Justice Party (MB/FJP) candidate for President of Egypt.
The SCAF officers stated that their commander, Field Marshall Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, was concerned that the MB
followers, as well as many of the secular/liberal groups were becoming increasingly volatile during the extended vote
counting period. The MB representatives, after a call to Supreme Guide Mohammed Badie, assured the SCAF that there

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05794869 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

would be no violence before the election results were announced. The SCAF officers reiterated their previous position
that Tantawi and the SCAF do not want to rule the country, but they will not tolerate any move that limits either their

budget, or their position of respect in society. The MB officials, who were extremely happy with the news they had just
received, assured their SCAF interlocutors that Badie, Morsi, and the rest of the MB leadership were committed to this
position.

         2. According to a very sensitive source, the MB officials added that Morsi would chose government officials from

a wide spectrum of parties and movements, ranging from the Salafist al Nour party to secular/liberal groups like the April 6
Movement. The SCAF officers had no problem with this, but added that the current military decrees would remain in
place, at least until the constitution is drafted and a new parliament is elected. In the opinion of this individual, the MB
representatives were under instructions from Badie to avoid getting into an argument on this point, at this particular time.
Having won the presidency, Badie and his advisors believe that public opinion, and political momentum will allow the MB
to dominate the entire government. In this regard he also believes it is important that the MB not overreach, as Morsi, and

the FJP speaker of Parliament, Saad Al-Katany had done in the weeks leading up to the second round of voting.

         3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Badie believes that the aggressive tactics of the MB/FJP
supporters, in the period immediately before the second round of voting, led to Tantawi moving to dissolve parliament,
and redefine the duties of the president. The Supreme Guide wants Morsi to realize that if they maintain their studied
pace, they will get everything they want. The MB polling noted that despite the fact that Morsi's opponent Ahmed Shafik

is a former commanding general of the Air Force, approximately seventy (70) per cent of the regular army troops
supported the MB candidate. At the same time, as many as forty (40) per cent of the members of the April 6 movement
also voted for Morsi. The MB leadership also intends to include Coptic Christians and some women in the new
government, in an effort to the new Egypt as an inclusive, moderate Islamic State. Their challenge is to find individuals
who they feel they can trust, and who are willing to serve under Morsi. According to this individual, the Coptic community
in particular is frustrated over what it sees as voter fraud and intimidation of its members by the FJP in Christian areas.)

         4. At the end of this meeting, according to this source, the MB and SCAF representatives agreed to stay in
contact and to do what is necessary to prevent any violence, while recognizing the important role the military will continue
to play in Egyptian society. Both sides recognize that there will be incidents resulting from the political passions at play in
the country, and agree that they must prevent these incidents from getting out of hand. The SCAF officers also agreed
that they would not overreact to statements from MB supporters regarding a reduced role for the military in government.
The SCAF officers added that Tantawi was not unhappy with the result of the election, as he and Shafik have a poor
personal relationship, and a history of competition for power within the military under the regime of the former President

Hosni Mubarak.

         5. (Source Comment: According to this individual, both sides agreed that their first order of business together in
the new Egyptian political situation will be developing a coherent policy toward Israel. The SCAF officers pointed out that
 Israel is extremely concerned about the changes in Egypt. The MB officials added that they would like to maintain and
enhance the policy the SCAF and MB developed during the 2011 uprising: maintaining the Peace Treaty with Israel, while

limiting joint activity and cooperation on sensitive security matters. Both sides also agreed that, after the election, it will be
 important to create a positive working environment for foreign firms, particularly those from the United States and Western
 Europe. The MB officials stated that Badie and Morsi are firmly committed to a dual Islamic/Western banking system and
good relations with Western firms. He regularly states that the West has dealt with Saudi Arabia for many years and the
system he anticipates for Egypt will be far less restrictive than the one put in place by the Saudi rulers. Badie also
 believes the fact that Morsi was educated in the United States and has many good contacts in that country.)

         6. The representatives of the MB and the SCAF will meet again during the week of June 25, and will continue
 regular contact as they prepare for the drafting of the new Constitution and parliamentary elections. Both sides agreed
that they must also keep a careful eye on the situation in Syria, which could spread to Lebanon and other countries,
 potentially creating a situation affecting Egypt's security.

Stupak and his coalition.

I'm also copying below the text of the EO that was part of the deal.

With Stupak, Final Pieces Falling Into Place

Jonathan Cohn

The New Republic

The abortion issue isn't going to stop health care reform.

In a late afternoon press conference, Michigan Rep. Bart Stupak and six of his Democratic colleagues announced that
they were dropping their objections to the Senate bill, thanks to a new executive order that makes clear taxpayer dollars

won't finance abortion services. Instead, the seven Democrats said, they will vote yes when the Senate bill comes up for
consideration later tonight. They will also vote against an expected "motion to recommit" by the Republicans, which the

GOP could have used to stop a vote from happening today.

With the support of Stupak and his allies, the Democrats appear to have the support they need to pass reform. Stupak
himself said the Democrats were "well past 216"--the number that would constitute a majority.

The executive order would seem merely to apply existing law, as codified in the Hyde amendment, to the new insurance

exchanges through which individuals and some small businesses will be purchasing coverage. In fact, it's not clear that
the executive order actually changes anything: The Senate bill wouldn't have allowed taxpayer funding of abortion

anyway.

Then again, it's never been clear—at least to me--why Stupak objected to the Senate bill in the first place.

Be that as it may, Stupak indicated he was proud to vote for a bill that would make health insurance both more available
and more protective. His colleague Marcy Kaptur, of Ohio, went further, describing the measure as a "true life bill"

because it not only would help reduce abortion, but also improve health care.

She spoke at length about the importance of improving maternal and pediatric care--and noted that, according to a
recent study, abortions seemed to decline as people get better access to care. Kaptur said that "never again will any

woman have to say she can't continue a pregnancy to term" because she felt she couldn't afford the care.

In response to a reporter's question, Stupak acknowledged that the Conference of Catholic Bishops--who had spear-
headed opposition to the Senate bill and whose judgment Stupak repeatedly cited--did not support the deal. But he said

that modifying the actual bill to restrict abortion funding further was simply not possible, given the lack of votes for it in
the Senate. Several other Catholic groups, including the Catholic Health Association, have said they endorse the Senate

bill--and that the Catholic Bishops are wrong in their interpretation of the proposal's impact.

ENSURING ENFORCEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ABORTION RESTRICTIONS IN THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including

the "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act" (approved March'    	   2010), I hereby order as follows:

Section 1. Policy.

Following the recent passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("the Act"), it is necessary to establish an
adequate enforcement mechanism to ensure that Federal funds are not used for abortion services (except in cases of

rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered), consistent with a longstanding Federal statutory
restriction that is commonly known as the Hyde Amendment. The purpose of this Executive Order is to establish a

comprehensive, government-wide set of policies and procedures to achieve this goal and to make certain that all
relevant actors--Federal officials, state officials (including insurance regulators) and health care providers--are aware of

their responsibilities, new and old.

The Act maintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to the
newly-created health insurance exchanges. Under the Act, longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience (such as the

Church Amendment, 42 U.S.C. §300a-7, and the Weldon Amendment, Pub. L. No. 111-8, §508(d)(1) (2009)) remain
intact and new protections prohibit discrimination against health care facilities and health care providers because of an

unwillingness to provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.

Numerous executive agencies have a role in ensuring that these restrictions are enforced, including the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Office of Personnel

Management (OPM).

Section 2. Strict Compliance with Prohibitions on Abortion Funding in Health Insurance Exchanges. The Act specifically
prohibits the use of tax credits and cost-sharing reduction payments to pay for abortion services (except in cases of rape

or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered) in the health insurance exchanges that will be
operational in 2014. The Act also imposes strict payment and accounting requirements to ensure that Federal funds are

not used for abortion services in exchange plans (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would
be endangered) and requires state health insurance commissioners to ensure that exchange plan funds are segregated

by insurance companies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, OMB funds management circulars,
and accounting guidance provided by the Government Accountability Office.

I hereby direct the Director of OMB and the Secretary of HHS to develop, within 180 days of the date of this Executive

Order, a model set of segregation guidelines for state health insurance commissioners to use when determining whether
exchange plans are complying with the Act's segregation requirements, established in Section 1303 of the Act, for

enrollees receiving Federal financial assistance. The guidelines shall also offer technical information that states should
follow to conduct independent regular audits of insurance companies that participate in the health insurance exchanges.

In developing these model guidelines, the Director of OMB and the Secretary of HHS shall consult with executive
agencies and offices that have relevant expertise in accounting principles, including, but not limited to, the Department

 of the Treasury, and with the Government Accountability Office. Upon completion of those model guidelines, the
 Secretary of HHS should promptly initiate a rulemaking to issue regulations, which will have the force of law, to interpret

the Act's segregation requirements, and shall provide guidance to state health insurance commissioners on how to

 comply with the model guidelines.

 Section 3. Community Health Center Program.

 The Act establishes a new Community Health Center (CHC) Fund within HHS, which provides additional Federal funds for

 the community health center program. Existing law prohibits these centers from using federal funds to provide abortion

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768906 Date: 02/26/2016</span>

services (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered), as a result of both the

Hyde Amendment and longstanding regulations containing the Hyde language. Under the Act, the Hyde language shall
apply to the authorization and appropriations of funds for Community Health Centers under section 10503 and all other

relevant provisions. I hereby direct the Secretary of HHS to ensure that program administrators and recipients of Federal
funds are aware of and comply with the limitations on abortion services imposed on CHCs by existing law. Such actions

should include, but are not limited to, updating Grant Policy Statements that accompany CHC grants and issuing new
interpretive rules.

Section 4. General Provisions.

(a) Nothing in this Executive Order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) authority granted by law or
presidential directive to an agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and

Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This Executive Order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of

appropriations.

(c)This Executive Order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,
enforceable at law or in equity against the United States, its departments, agencies, entities, officers, employees or

agents, or any other person.

Dear Cheryl:

   You might have received a copy of this e-mail last night or this morning. If so, please disregard this e-mail
and my apologies for the confusion. It appears, however, that Georgetown's e-mail system had a problem and
the earlier e-mail was most likely lost. So, trying again	        My best, Barry

TO: Cheryl D. Mills

      Counselor of the Department and Chief of Staff
      U.S. Department of State

Dear Cheryl:

   First, I want to applaud tardily Secretary Clinton's efforts to convince the U.S. Government and the United
Nations to decide to intervene for very good reasons in Libya last March. As you probably well know, U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1973 was the first U.N. approval for humanitarian intervention against the will of a

country with major military forces because of that country's treatment of its own citizens. The United States
and its NATO allies were unable to obtain such a U.N. resolution in the Kosovo situation in 1999, though NATO
went ahead with the bombing campaign.

   Second, I also applaud Secretary Clinton's initiative, announced last Thursday, to ask Congress to pass a
law to allow some of the approximately $34 billion in frozen Libyan funds to be used to support the Libyan
rebels.

   I wanted, however, to raise with you a warning flag. The budget hawks in Congress and elsewhere might
well also push to divert some of the frozen assets to pay for the U.S. military activities in and around Libya-
e.g., the bombs, fuel for our planes and ships, and related costs—or even that some of the funds be used

generally to reduce the U.S. deficit.

   I attended an off-the-record meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations about three weeks ago where,

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05785108 Date: 02/19/2016</span>

among others, some smart lawyers and former political appointees fromthe Bush Administration discussed the

possibility of using the Libyan funds to help pay the U.S. military costs of its role in Libya. This last week I
heard a conservative lawyer propose that some the funds be used for deficit reduction. I do not know whether
the idea of diverting some of the frozen funds has reached budget hawks like Rep. Paul Ryan or Tea Party'ers,
but I expect it will soon arise in the course of the debate over this Administration's proposal to help the rebels.

   A related point. It is understandable that the Administration wants to involve Congress in the decision to
provide funds to the Libyan rebels. I believe, however, that here is a strong legal case that new Congressional
approval is not needed for the President if he wants to take title to some or all of the $34 billion and use it
however he directs. David Aufhauser, the former General Counsel in Treasury under President George W.
Bush, supports that view (and agreed that I might use his name). Indeed, David was a key participant in

Bush's unfreezing and taking title to over $1 billion in Iraqi assets after our 2003 invasion of Iraq, and then
sending the funds back to the Development Fund for Iraq. Bush took the action pursuant to a 2001
amendment to the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. § 1702 (a)(1)(C). It
provides that the President may take title to the frozen assets and decide how they are used, sold, etc., "when
the United States is engaged in armed hostilities" with a country.

   On a personal note. I believe that diverting the funds to reduce our deficit or to pay the U.S. military's
expenses would be inconsistent with President Obama's statements, such as: "[T]he money doesn't belong to
Qaddafi or to us—it belongs to the Libyan people." It would be inconsistent with U.N. Security Council
Resolutions 1970 and 1973. And it would lead many Libyans and many of our allies to question our

intentions. The crudest charge might be that we would be wrongfully using Muslimmoney to fund a war
against Muslims.

   Hope this is helpful.

                           My best, Barry

P.S. I have also brought this possible support for unwanted diversions of the frozen Libyan assets to the

attention of U/S Bob Hormats, as well as Tom Delare in EEB and David Mortlock in L. I regularly work with
Tomand David in my role as chair of the Sanctions Subcommittee of the State Department's Advisory
Committee on International Economic Policy (ACIEP). (Tom and David have been outstanding in their
cooperation with the Subcommittee.) However, given the likely fast pace of events after Secretary Clinton's
announcement last Thursday, I thought it might be helpful to pass this information on to you directly.

Climate Proposal Puts Practicality

Ahead of Sacrifice

By JOHN TIERNEY

The current issue of the journal Science contains a proposal to slow global warming that is
extraordinary for a couple of reasons:

1.In theory, it would help people living in poor countries now, instead of mainly benefiting

their descendants.

2.In practice, it might actually work.

This proposal comes from an international team of researchers — in climate modeling,

atmospheric chemistry, economics, agriculture and public health — who started off with a
question that borders on heresy in some green circles: Could something be done about global

warming besides forcing everyone around the world to use less fossil fuel?

Ever since the Kyoto Protocol imposed restrictions in industrial countries, the first priority of

environmentalists has been to further limit the emission of carbon dioxide. Burning fewer

fossil fuels is the most obvious way to counteract the greenhouse effect, and the notion has
always had a wonderfully virtuous political appeal — as long as it's being done by someone

else.

But as soon as people are asked to do it themselves, they follow a principle identified by

Roger Pielke Jr. in his book "The Climate Fix." Dr. Pielke, a political scientist at the

University of Colorado, calls it iron law of climate policy: When there's a conflict between
policies promoting economic growth and policies restricting carbon dioxide, economic growth

wins every time.

The law holds even in the most ecologically correct countries of Europe, as Dr. Pielke found

by looking at carbon reductions from 1990 unti2010.

 The Kyoto Protocol was supposed to put Europe on a new energy path, but it contained so

 many loopholes that the rate of "decarbonization" in Europe did not improve in the years
 after 1998, when the protocol was signed, or af2002, when it was ratified. In fact, Europe's

 economy became more carbon-intensive in  2010, he says — a trend that seems likely to

 continue as nuclear power plants are shut down in Germany and replaced by coal-burning

 ones.

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793369 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

"People will make trade-offs, but the one thing that won't be traded off is keeping the lights

on at reasonable cost," he says. Given the reluctance of affluent Europeans to make sacrifices,
what are the odds of persuading billions of people in poorer countries to pay more for energy

today in return for a cooler climate at the end of the century?

But suppose they were offered a deal with immediate benefits, like the one proposed in

Science by researchers in the United States, Britain, Italy, Austria, Thailand and Kenya. The

team looked at ways to slow global warming while also reducing the soot and smog that are

damaging agriculture and health.

Black carbon, the technical term for the soot spewed from diesel engines and traditional

cookstoves and kilns, has been blamed for a significant portion of the recent warming in the
Arctic and for shrinking glaciers in the Himalayas. Snow ordinarily reflects the sun's rays, but

when the white landscape is covered with soot, the darker surface absorbs heat instead.

Methane, which is released from farms, landfills, coal mines and petroleum operations,

contributes to ground-level ozone associated with smog and poorer yields from crops. It's also

a greenhouse gas that, pound for pound, is far more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping

the sun's heat.

After looking at hundreds of ways to control these pollutants, the researchers determined the

14 most effective measures for reducing climate change, like encouraging a switch to cleaner
 diesel engines and cookstoves, building more efficient kilns and coke ovens, capturing

 methane at landfills and oil wells, and reducing methane emissions from rice paddies by

 draining them more often.

 If these strategies became widespread, the researchers calculate, the amount of global

 warming in 2050 would be reduced by about one degree Fahrenheit, roughly a third of the

 warming projected if nothing is done. This impact on temperatures in 2050 would be
 significantly larger than the projected impact of the commonly proposed measures for

 reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

 Not incidentally, the researchers calculate, these reductions in low-level ozone and black

 carbon would yield lots of benefits long before 2050. Because people would be breathing

 cleaner air, 700,000 to 4.7 million premature deaths would be avoided each year. Thanks to

 improved crop yields, farmers would produce at least 30 million more metric tons of food
 annually.

 "The beauty of these pollution-control measures is that over five to 10 years they pay for

 themselves in the developing world," says Drew Shindell, the lead author of the proposal, who

 is a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and at Columbia

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793369 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

University. "They slow global warming, but there are local benefits, too. If you make black

carbon reductions in China or India, you get most of the benefits in China or India."

These ideas already have a few fans, including Ted Nordhaus, a founder of the Breakthrough
Institute which has endorsed similar measures in a report called "Climate Pragmatism." Mr.

Nordhaus sees the Science paper as a model for the future.

"This is what the post-Kyoto world will look like," he says. "We'll increasingly be managing

ecological problems like global warming, not solving them. We may make some headway in

limiting our emissions, but if we do so it will be through innovating better energy

technologies and implementing them at the national and regional level, not through top-

down international limits."

These pollution-control policies aren't especially controversial — even Republicans hostile to
environmentalists have supported research into black carbon — but neither have they have

been especially popular. Mainstream environmental groups haven't put them on the agenda.

One reason is the lack of glamour: Encouraging villagers to use diesel engine filters and drain

their rice paddies is less newsworthy than negotiating a global treaty on carbon at a United

Nations conference.

Another reason is the fear of distracting people from the campaign against carbon dioxide,
the gas with the most long-term impact. Because it lingers in the atmosphere much longer

than soot or methane, some scientists argue that limiting it must be the first step. Dr. Shindell

says he agrees with the need to limit carbon dioxide and sympathizes with those who worry

about losing focus.

"But I also worry that carbon dioxide will go up even if we do focus on it," he says. "We're at a

complete deadlock on carbon dioxide. Dealing with the short-lived pollutants might really be
a way to bridge some of the differences, both between the two sides in the United States and

between the developed and the developing world."

No matter what people think about global warming, there aren't a lot of fans of dirty snow,

poor crops and diseased lungs.

An African Adventure, and a Revelation

By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso

TAKE an American student and an American teacher who have never been near Africa before, lead them on a crazed "win a trip"

journey through five particularly wretched countries, and what do you get?

Well, a few mishaps. There was that angry mob in Mauritania — who would have thought our cameras would upset people that much?

And that bull elephant in Niger was equally inhospitable, although the giraffes seemed amiable as they approached to gawk at the

strange white humans.

We encountered plenty of heartbreak, like the baby we met in Niger who was going blind from lack of vitamin A. In some places, we felt

the gnawing disquiet of insecurity. The rise of banditry and a Qaeda network in West Africa forced us to take an armed escort across one
particularly lawless stretch of "highway."

Yet my travel buddies and I also found something far more significant on our journey: hope. One of the best-kept secrets in the world

today can be found in thatched-roof villages like the ones we passed through: Africa appears to be turning around.

After a half-century of underperformance, Africa's economy is growing significantly faster than America's or Europe's. In the last

decade, 6 of the io fastest growing economiin the world were in sub-Saharan Africa, and, as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham

 Clinton noted in recent speech in Ethiopithat proportion is expected to rise even higher in the next five years. The global economy

 has turned upside down: Europe risks imploding, while much of Africa is booming.

 This was the fifth "win-a-trip contest," in which I take a student with me on a reporting trip to the developing world. This year I also
 chose someone from the over-6o crowd. The student winner waSaumya Dave,  a medical student from Atlanta, and the older winner

 was Noreen Connolly,a 66-year-old teacher from a Catholic school in Newark. Neither had ever been to Africa, and they proved

 wonderful travel companions, cheery even when I explained why not to leave food on a bedside table in a hotel (I once awoke to gaze

 into the eyes of three rats) or when Saumya came down with a fever that we feared might be malaria (it wasn't). There was only one

 experience that my winners balked at: a villager in Burkina Faso asked for Saumya's hand in marriage.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780941 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

Our odyssey began in mid-June. Accompanied by an Atlanta photographer and videographer, Thomas Nybo, and armed with everything

from satellite phones to mosquito bed nets — all jammed into tiny bags so we wouldn't have to check luggage — we flew from New York
to Casablanca, Morocco.

Morocco is a window into one of the most striking trends in Africa: democratization. The number of electoral democracies in Africa has

risen to 18 from 4 in the last decade, according to Freedom House, a nonprofit human rights organization based in Washington. Even in

a country like Morocco, which is still a repressive monarchy, easing has occurred. It has freed some political prisoners, moved to

strengthen its Parliament a bit and even established a truth and reconciliation commission.

This is how Saumya Dave experienced Morocco:

"On that firstmorning, we met areporter who introduced us    to protesters who had been beaten and arrested.

'The protesters were young, outspoken, rebellious, headstrong — and endearing. They answered all of our questions with ease, insisting

that the efforts already made by the king were superficial, only for show. They were also fearless.

"We get beaten in school and by our parents all the time,' Imad, one of the protesters said, a grin emerging. 'So being beaten by the

police is nothing."

From Morocco we flew south to Nouakchott, the sleepy capital of Mauritania. I had been a bit disappointed that no pro-democracy

protests in Morocco or Mauritania coincided with our visits — but we did stumble across a melee in Nouakchott. Its target: us.

A Mauritanian host took us to the open fish market, and we strolled through. Suddenly a very large fishmonger grabbed Thomas,

outraged by the camera dangling from his neck, and suddenly dozens of others were milling around us and shouting. One of our drivers
tried to pull the man off Thomas, and then fists were flying and our driver was suddenly in a headlock. We tried to retreat, and the

original troublemaker let go of Thomas long enough to pick up a huge wooden pallet and attempt to smash it down on our vehicles.

Fortunately, a policeman rushed over and helped us escape, and we never figured out quite why this tumult had happened.   A fluke, I

think.

In Nouakchott, we joined forces with Shawn Baker,   the Africa head ofHelen Keller International,an aid group that does outstanding

work on nutrition, blindness and related issues. Shawn, who came to Africa in the 198os in the Peace Corps and never moved back,

showed us one of the most cost-effective interventions to save lives — food fortification.

These were Noreen Connolly's reactions that day:

"I never paid attention to the 'fortified with' words on the bag of my sandwich bread. So I was amazed to visit a flour mill in Mauritania

and find that food fortification could have a huge impact on the health of a people.

"When people die of hunger-related causes, the problem is often not so much a lack of calories as a lack of micronutrients like iron and

zinc. The biggest flour mill in Mauritania, supplying 45 percent of the country's flour, had just started adding iron, zinc, folic acid and
vitamin  B12 toits flour — at an added cost of only 1 penny for six baguettes.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780941 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

"American foreign aid money helped pay the start-up cost of fortification, and the mill will pay all continuing costs. We watched the
machines add tiny quantities of the nutrients to sacks of flour — and realized that this mill might end up saving more lives than a

hospital."

There has been a backlash in recent years against exaggerated claims about the impact of humanitarian aid. It's true that aid groups

sometimes make the conquest of poverty seem a simpler and more certain endeavor than it is. It's also true that because of initiatives

like food fortification — and vaccinations and vitamin A supplementation and many others — child mortality is tumbling in the

developing world. In 1990, 12.4 million children died annually before age 5, according to the World Health Organization. By 2009,

despite a significantly larger population, the toll had dropped to 8.1 million, the W.H.O. says.

So, yes, foreign aidhasmyriadproblems, andglobal povertyisfartoopersistent —but fourmillionlivessavedayearisan

extraordinaryachievement. AndtheObamaadministrationdeservesreal credit forits           Feed the Future aid initiative. This isn't sexy or

well known, but it bolsters African agriculture and nutrition as a cheap and effective way to chip away at global poverty and disease.

With Shawn, we drove south across the Mauritanian desert to Senegal, and then flew the following day to Niger — one of the poorest

and most forlorn countries in the world. In the remote town of Dogon Doutchi, near the Nigerian border, we saw with heartbreaking
clarity what doctors call severe acute malnutrition.

A 2-year-old child, Alou Muhammad, was lying nearly comatose on a cot in the local hospital, his ribs protruding, receiving fluid from

an IV drip. Alou's left eye had Bitot's spots — signs of vitamin A deficiency that lead to blindnesAt least 2S0,000 children go blind

each year for lack of vitamin A, according to the W.H.O., and half of them die within a year of going blind.

This was Saumya's report:

"The local hospital was unlike anything I had ever seen. No hand sanitizer dispenser. No faces covered with scrub masks. No supply

closet. No physicians streaming down the hallway in stark white coats.

"Alou was in pain, screaming 'Mama!' between sobs. I have seen malnourished children, but this was the first time I could count each

rib."

Alou's family told us that Alou had contracted measles and gone downhill from there. Yet there was also a silver lining: this was the first

measles case that the head doctor had seen since arriving at the hospital seven months earlier — and Alou actually came from across the

border in Nigeria.

Children in Niger now routinely are vaccinated for measles, and also get vitamin A drops to prevent blindness and death. So even
though Niger is one of the world's poorest countries, it has figured out how to deliver these services to its citizens — while Nigeria,

incomparably richer, still allows children like Alou to catch measles and then compels them to receive charity in Niger.

"If Niger can make progress, anybody can," Shawn told us as we huddled around Alou's bed. "When I started here in 1985 there were

 measles outbreaks every year, and some years they would just massacre kids. But that head doctor has been here seven months, and this

 is the first case she has seen."

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780941 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

When I first backpacked through West Africa as a law student in 1982, what I found most wrenching were the ubiquitous blind beggars,

victims of a disease called river blindness, spread by the bites of black flies. The flies carry parasites that grow into worms whose

offspring eat away at the optic nerve and cause blindness, debilitating itching and excruciating pain.

"This was more painful than childbirth," Fatouma Oumarou, a 70-year-old woman who had gone blind from the ailment, told us when

we visited her village. At the peak of the disease, she recalled, much of the land in the area was left fallow because farmers did not dare
work the area. In a nearby village, Moli, in a wildlife refuge, people told us that lions had killed a 15-year-old in the fields, but added,

"We are more afraid of the black flies than of the lions."

Yet these days river blindness is gone from this region, thanks partly theroic work by Jimmy Carter,   and tovast contributionsof

medicine by Merck. I asked villagers iftheyhadeverheardof JimmyCarter, andtheyshooktheirheadsdoubtfully—but hispost-

presidencyworkonglobal healthhadtransformedtheir lives.

AIDS stilt exacts a huge toll on Africa —an additional 1.8 million Africans became infectedwithH.I.V. in  2009, the last year for which a

figure is available — but we saw progress. In Burkina Faso, we visited women who during labor received anti-retrovirals that

significantly reduced the risk of mother-to-child transmission. It's a cheap, simple intervention that avoids the need for lifelong

medication for the child.

"There is unprecedented progress in global health," Michel Kazatchkine, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria,  told me. "Things that we would have seen as a dream in  2001  now are achievable objectives. A world of

almost no malaria deaths. A world with almost no mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V."

Partly because Noreen is a teacher, we often stopped in villages and asked about education. Often we ran into children who didn't go to

school at all. But that's becoming rare, and girls in particular are more likely to attend school now than a decade ago. The United

Nations says that primary school enrollment in sub-Saharan Africa has increased five times as quickly since 1999 as it did in the

previous decade.

We also asked whether the schools really functioned — it's common in poor countries for a school building to exist, but for teachers not

to show up. We encountered some of that.

We saw many reminders that technology was transforming lives. A generation ago, many in the countryside had to collect water from
mud puddles, while now there are covered wells with clean water.

In a few places we saw solar panels used to power electric lights. Roads are improving, and motorcycles and trucks are more common.
One result is that when a mother is in difficult or life-threatening labor, she can now sometimes be taken to a hospital in the back of a

pickup truck instead of rolled there in a wheelbarrow.

The grandest new technology is the cellphone. "More than 100 people here have cellphones," one woman told us proudly in her village

in Burkina Faso. "There are too many to count." We asked how many toilets the village had, and she explained that not a single home

had yet installed an outhouse.

 Why would people prioritize cellphones over toilets? With cellphones, families can find out what market town offers the best price for

 their goods, or where fertilizer is cheapest. They can save money or transfer it, for cellphones are becoming the banking system for the

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780941 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

poor. They can find out where there are jobs, or if contraceptives are finally in stock at the clinic a half-day's hike away. The villagers

were equally intrigued that we thought toilets so crucial, and one explained, "It's just easier to go in the fields."

Family planning remains a huge challenge. Only 23 percent of women in sub-Saharan Africa use contraceptives, and we talked to some

women who had never even heard of family planning.

"I don't want any more babies," Hawa Samaila told us in one village in Niger. "If I can get something to stop getting pregnant, I'd like
that." She had had 12
                      babies, of whom 6 had died. If African women (who now average more than five children each) had only 2.7 births
on average  (the rate now in India),Africa would benefit enormously.

Yet family planning remains under-financed, and in a clinic we visited in Mauritania the head nurse, Ould Yatma, said that to receive

contraceptives a woman must prove that her husband has consented. "She must bring her husband, or at least bring her husband's ID

card to prove that he agrees."

Saumya talked to the women about that and this is what she found out:

"While there are women unable to receive contraceptives without a husband's consent, there are also women educating one another. In

Niger, one woman told me that girls are enrolled in literacy classes — which become secure havens for them to discuss issues without

men present. One of those topics: family planning.

"Often I met women who were empowered in other ways. In one village, a woman taught Noreen and me how to grind millet, using a

huge stick in an oversize mortar. She made it seem effortless and fluid, for women sometimes spend six hours a day grinding grain into

flour.

"Then Noreen and I tried. Lift, smash, lift, smash. Within minutes, we were exhausted, our biceps sore. This woman's 10-year-old
daughter outshone us both.

"Before I traveled through these countries, my image of an African woman was of a helpless, downtrodden creature who could do little
on her own. I am happy to be proved wrong."

Another obstacle that we encountered firsthand was corruption and suffocating bureaucracy. As we crossed the Mauritania-Senegal

border on a ferry, we saw trucks that had been waiting for a month to cross — because of a dispute between government officials on each

side. At the Niger-Burkina Faso border, we again saw huge lineups of trucks waiting for customs inspections (which, translated into the

local patois, often means payments to officials to avoid an inspection).

African leaders need to promote trade, simplify border crossings, reduce the opportunities for graft and encourage home-grown private

business. Niger should be ashamed that its thicket of regulatory requirements make it one of the worst countries in the world in which

to do business, according to the World Bank's terrificDoing Business series. (Niger ranks 173rd out of 183 countries in the2011 report.)

Another huge burden that we witnessed along much of our journey: civil conflict and insecurity. One of the most robust franchises of Al

Qaeda is one we don't hear much about in America, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. It has created a sanctuary for itself in northern
Mali — that's one reason we didn't try to visit Timbuktu, which is in that region. This branch of Al Qaeda has kidnapped foreigners,

apparently for ransom at least as much as for ideological reasons, in a belt from Mauritania to Niger.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780941 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

 In January two Frenchmen were abducted from a bar in the Niger capital, Niamey. A rescue operation led to a firefight in which both

 men were killed. We heard accounts that Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb was fortifying its army with weapons smuggled from looted
 Libyan armories.

 The group also profits byinviting in cocaine smugglers
                                                        who fly drugs in from South America and then move them on to Europe.

 Noreen reported on the question of terrorism and democracy:

•"In Mauritania, we met a pro-democracy writer and activist, Abderrahmane Weddady, who made the case that the autocratic

 Mauritanian government manipulated American fears of terrorists. The United States supports Mauritania partly because its military
 fights Al Qaeda — but Mr. Weddady argues that it is the Mauritanian government's oppression, corruption and economic incompetence

 that actually drive people to Al Qaeda.

"The United States plays into the hands of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb when it supports undemocratic governments like his own,

 he said. 'The real stability is democracy,' Mr. Weddady told us. And yes, it was a little odd to be lectured about the transformative power

 of democracy — by a Mauritanian."

 We had been told in advance that the first stretch of road after we crossed into Burkina Faso might be risky even in daytime — more

 from banditry than from Al Qaeda — so we arranged a military escort. "There shouldn't be a problem," added the person who arranged

the armed escorts. "But if there is, get your heads down. They feel that their job is to shoot."

That's the kind of Africa story you normally hear — a dash of guns and chaos — and it's real, but also incomplete. As my win-a-trip

 winners found on this journey, the poverty is heartbreaking and the insecurity ominous. But the giraffes and villagers alike are hugely
 welcoming, and the progress is now effervescent. The backdrop is a continent that is chipping away at poverty and disease, while doing

 a better job of educating its young. Africa seems likely to become a much more important part of the global economy in the 21st century

 — a place to admire, not to pity.

 Below are two documents: One is a memo from

 The other document consists of notes from my conversation with William Murray, former station

 Afghan resistance to the Soviet occupation. Murray also served as station chief elsewhere,

 Afghanistan.

 1.

 Counterinsurgency — a much failed strategy?

 Bernard Fall was one of the most significant theoreticians and practitioner of Counterinsurgency
 (COIN) in the 20th Century. He was the expert most listened to at the Special Warfare Center at
 Ft. Bragg when LTG William Yarborough commanded the school there in the Kennedy and
 Johnson eras.

 Fall defined COIN clearly. He said that: Counterinsurgency = political reform + economic
 development + counter guerrilla operations

 This theory of warfare was developed by the colonial powers as a "cure" for the wave on "wars
 of national liberation" that swept through their overseas possessions after World War Two.

                                              1

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765724 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

  Because of these revolts against authority most of the European powers found themselves faced
  with colonized populations engaged in extended attempts to obtain independence from the

  metropole. Such rebellions were usually based on ethnic and racial differences with the
  colonizers and were often led by vanguard Left parties with communist connections. That
  connection caused an eventual American policy commitment to the COIN struggle. That
  commitment sometimes occurred as a partner of the colonial power (Vietnam in the late '40s and
  `50s) and sometimes as a successor to the colonial power after at least partial independence had
  bee achieved. (Vietnam after the French)

  COIN theory was seen by both the former colonial officers who taught it at Bragg and their
  American disciples of the time as the opposite of the methods of the anti-colonial insurgents who
  were thought to practice something called "revolutionary warfare." (RW)

  Revolutionary Warfare + Political subversion (including propaganda) + economic transformation
 (usually socialist) + guerilla warfare (to include terrorism)

 The central idea behind COIN was seen as competitive reformed government and economic
 development for the population that was at least potentially supported the insurgents RW
 movement. It was believed that if this population was "protected" from the RW efforts of the

 insurgent movement, then the population would choose to side with the counterinsurgents
 whether the counterinsurgents were the local post-colonial government or an occupying power.

 This doctrine was widely applied across the world in the middle and late 20  thCentury. There
 were successes and there were failures.

 Successes:

 The British suppression of the "Malayan Emergency" was probably the greatest success of the
 counterinsurgents. In Malaya the British colonial authorities faced a clearly communist guerrilla
 movement that consisted altogether of overseas Chinese living in the midst of a majority Malay
 and Muslim population. The area of operations was a peninsula nearly completely surrounded
 by ocean areas dominated by the British Navy. The British forces suffered from cross

 department coordination issues early in the campaign, but once those were solved and the
 "Communist Terrorists" (CTs) isolated in the jungles and rubber plantations all that was needed
 to defeat them was persistence in small unit patrolling until the CTs were exterminated. There
 were never more than a few hundred of them. The British succeeded in suppressing this revolt
 but what did this successful effort cost them. It was enormously expensive and success was
 followed by British withdrawal from Malaya and the creation of an independent Malaysia

 completely dominated by the Malay ethnic adversaries of the overseas Chinese.

  Kenya and Cyprus were both gripped by revolts by the Kikuyu and Greek populations
 respectively. In both cases, RW campaigns based on terrorism were fought to a standstill by the
 British only to be followed by political decisions on the part of the British government to
 abandon these countries and allow the ascent to power of the former leaders of the insurgencies,
 Kenyatta and Makarios respectively.

 In Latin America, where I participated in several COIN efforts, the Kennedy created "Alliance
 for Progress" sought to defeat local insurgencies inspired and led by cadres from Castro's Cuba.
 These countries were particularly good targets for communist inspired RW because the political
 and economic structures of the Central American and Andean states were so clearly unfair and

 un-democratic that local populations of underfed Indians and peasants could be easily
 proselytized In the process of RW. In many cases in Latin America the low level economic
 development efforts of the civil and military arms of the US Government met with considerable
 success. Villagers were protected from the insurgents, local (village economies) were improved.
 Medical treatment was provided to those who had never known it. Nevertheless, the "Alliance

 for Progress" can not be considered a strategic success. Why? The local elites in all these
 countries quickly perceived the COIN campaign as a threat to their political privilege and wealth
 in land and simply refused to institute the reforms sponsored by the alliance. Much the same
 thing happened in various parts of Africa and Southwest Asia where it was attempted.

 Failures

 The American war in Vietnam is a typical example of failure of the COIN theory. The massive
 communist led Viet Minh independence movement was a classic example of RW in all its
 components taken to its ultimate development in the creation of a regular army for the insurgent
 movement under the sponsorship of its Chinese communist ally. The United States participated
 in the French COIN effort against the Viet Minh and then became the sponsor of the post-

 colonial government left behind by the French on their departure. Contrary to popular legend (I
 served there for two years) the initial approach of the United States to the situation in South
 Vietnam was pure COIN right out of the Ft. Bragg School. Populations of villagers were
  protected, the South Vietnamese armed forces were developed, village militias were created for
 self defense, good government was preached to the Diem government in Saigon. Economic
  development was fostered. It was only when the government of North Vietnam decided that

  these methods were a serious bar to their eventual success in RW in the South and brought its
  regular army into South Vietnam in 1964 that US forces escalated their own deployment to the
  conventional war level. This was a necessary step if the eradication of the South Vietnamese
  government and the US COIN effort was to be avoided. There followed three years of
  conventional warfare between US and North Vietnamese forces. This warfare was largely
  conducted outside populated areas. COIN efforts continued during this period but took second
  place to the need to defeat or at least seriously weaken North Vietnam's army. In 1967 it was

  judged that this had been accomplished and COIN was once again made the centerpiece of
  American efforts in Vietnam. To accomplish this, a fully integrated civil/military COIN
  structure was created under the combined military command in Vietnam. This was called "Civil
  Operations, Revolutionary Development Support." (CORDS) I worked in this program for a
  year. (1968-1969) This effort had virtually unlimited money, ten thousand advisers in every
  aspect of Vietnamese civil society, business and government function and a massive coalition

  and south Vietnamese conventional force standing by to protect the population and the
  counterinsurgents of CORDS while they did their work. This COIN program was largely
  successful. A handover to the South Vietnamese forces was devised in the form of the
  "Vietnamization Program" and US forces were withdrawn in "trenches" (slices) over a couple of
  years. Following the Christmas, 1972 renewed bombing effort over North Vietnam (caused by

                                                  3

  North Vietnamese intransigence in Geneva) a ceasefire was reached and for two years there was
  quiet in South Vietnam with the South Vietnamese government holding much of the country. It
  was only after some minor incident on the world stage caused a revulsion in the American press

  and public against any further involvement in Vietnam that the US Congress passed a law
  forbidding any further aid to South Vietnam that the North Vietnamese decided to use their fine
  army to over run the country in a conventional war. Lesson —You can win the COIN war and
  still be defeated conventionally or politically at home.

  The French war in Algeria is another example of COIN success followed by political defeat and
  withdrawal. After a prolonged struggle, the French security force had largely defeated the
  Algerian native guerrillas of the Front National de Liberation (FLN). This struggle had been
  waged with all the aspects of classic COIN doctrine. The revolt had started in 1955. By 1960 the
  French Army, police and their Algerian allies had largely won the fight. As in Vietnam, two
  years then passed in relative quiet. In 1962 De Gaulle was elected president of France with a

  political vision that required independence for Algeria. That negated all the struggle and success
  of the CIIN war. Failure once again at the strategic level.

  Our war in Iraq is now cited as an example of the success of the COIN theory and its methods.
  In fact nothing of the sort occurred in Iraq. Remember —COIN = political reform + economic

  development + counter-guerilla operations. We have not brought on political reform in Iraq.
  What we have done is re-arrange the "players" in such a way that the formerly downtrodden Shia
  Arabs are now the masters. This has in no way reduced the potential for inter-communal armed
 struggle. We did not defeat the insurgents in counter guerrilla operations. What we did was
  bring more troops into the Baghdad area to enforce the separation of the ethno-sectarian
 communities while at the same time using traditional methods of "divide and conquer" to split

 off enough insurgents to form an effective force to use against Al-Qa'ida in Iraq and others
 whom we disapproved of. This is not counterinsurgency!!!

 Conclusion

 COIN is a badly flawed instrument of statecraft: Why?

 - The locals ultimately own the country being fought over. If they do not want the "reforms" you
 desire, they will resist you as we have been resisted in Iraq and Afghanistan. McChrystal's
 strategy paper severely criticized Karzai's government. Will that disapproval harden into a
 decision to act to find a better government or will we simply undercut Afghan central
 government and become the actual government?

 - Such COIN wars are expensive, long drawn out affairs that are deeply debilitating for the
 foreign counterinsurgent power. Reserves of money, soldiers and national will are not endless.
  Ultimately, the body politic of the counterinsurgent foreign power turns against the war and then
 all that has occurred has been a waste.

 - COIN theory is predicated on the ability of the counterinsurgents to change the mentality of the

 "protected" (read controlled) population. The sad truth is that most people do not want to be

                                                 4

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765724 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

 deprived of their ancestral ways and will fight to protect them. "Hearts and Minds" is an empty
 propagandist's phrase.

 - In the end the foreign counterinsurgent is embarked on a war that is not his own war. For him,

 the COIN war will always be a limited war, fought for a limited time with limited resources. For
 the insurgent, the war is total war. They have no where to escape to after a tour of duty. The
 psychological difference is massive.

 - For the counterinsurgent the commitment of forces must necessarily be much larger than for the
 insurgents. The counterinsurgent seeks to protect massive areas, hundreds of built up areas and

 millions of people. The insurgent can pick his targets. The difference in force requirements is
 crippling to the counterinsurgents.

 What should we do?

 - Hold the cities as bases to prevent a recognized Taliban government until some satisfactory (to

 us) deal is made among the Afghans.

 - Participate in international economic development projects for Afghanistan.

 - Conduct effective clandestine HUMINT out of the city bases against international jihadi
 elements.

 - Turn the tribes against the jihadi elements.

  - Continue to hunt and kill/capture dangerous jihadis,

  How long might you have to follow this program? It might be a long time but that would be
  sustainable. A full-blown COIN campaign in Afghanistan is not politically sustainable.

  There was a small group of us (CIA) who ran the war against the Soviets, about five of us. I was
  station chief in Pakistan from 1991-94. We were criticized by State for supporting the extremists.

  We always said we are only there to support those who fight. Our logic was that we had no
  political goal, just get the Soviets out. We should have demobilized the Afghans, but we didn't.

  Our goals were understood by the Afghans. We stuck to the message.

                                                 5

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765724 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

  The Afghanis hated the Arabs, hated them during the war against the Soviets. It's mythology
  they liked them, built by the press. You can't get the press to get off the blowback theory. Bin

  Laden, I doubt if he ever fired a gun in anger. He was there when I was there. He was
  engineering projects, roads, bridges and medical teams. But there was no big Arab fighting force.

  Milt Bearden and I met with Pakistani generals who contacted us in 2007 at their request, met
  with the key general from ISI who created the Taliban. The message to us was that the Brits
  shouldn't go into Helmand. They had thrown them out in 1880 and they would never accept

  them back. No one listened. I'm in contact with those people all the time. So is Milt. They don't
  believe us anymore. The US military has its own objective. They think we are fighting against
  Islam. The Afghanis will never perceive we are a secular society.

  The military reinforces the same things over and over again. We're literally fighting the people.

 The problem is not the number of troops. It's a failed mission. The Afghanis believe we are there
 to stay. That is the thing they will never accept. They will allow armies to go through and even
 stay for a few years, but not stay forever. I pity the president on his choices. He's torn by the
 military, with their typical just-give-us-the-troops. I don't see how to make this work.

 We need a clear mission, internationalize the message and set an attainable goal. The message

 should be: No place should be a sanctuary for a group that threatens the peace of the
 international community. There needs to be a clearly defined goal. We went there to get al Qaeda
 and get Bin Laden. We didn't go there to get the Taliban. We've shifted goals and we're trying
 to build a government in Afghanistan with a person who represents a small portion of the people
 and is corrupt.

 To me the message would be, we came to get AQ, this place can never a launch pad for terrorism
 against the West. Say we'll be out four months after we get Bin Laden. The Taliban are telling
 people we are there to stay forever. We talk about democracy, etc. They don't care. They care
 about the way of life. It's as simplistic as it gets. We can't afford to restructure that society.

 McChrystal is a military commander. He is going to solve the problem with more troops. We are
 exactly where the Soviets were in '86. We are hunkered down in large encampments, we sweep

 down, they lure us into ambushes.

 The problem is not the number of troops. It's a failed mission. We don't talk about Bin Laden
 anymore. We've never declared our objectives in a way the Afghan people understand. Too
 much talk about democracy and nation building. Obama should say we're here to get the people
 who distrub the international peace. I'd internationalize it. This is the whole world's problem.

 The AQ is a plague. What we want to achieve is the destruction of AQ and then we'll withdraw.
 You can make a deal they won't support AQ figures in the future.

 In Pakistan, it's hopeless. I sat in on every discusssion on the decision that led to cutting off aid
 in 1990. There was no doubt of what they were doing. Never once did a single Pakistani official
 deviate from saying that they were not making nuclear weapons. Every discussion began with a
 lie.

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765724 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

 I would close every Indian consulate all over Afghanistan. The Pakistanis believe they are
 funding the Taliban.

       Subj: Change of Government in Kyrgyzstan

       I have worked in the Kyrgyz Republic continuously since 1991
                   I became acquainted with each of the three Kyrgyz leaders from about that

       time, first meeting Askar Akayev in 1990 in Moscow, Kurmanbek Bakiyev in Djalalabad
       in 1993, and Roza Otunbayeva in Bishkek in 1992. I have had extended dealings with
       each of them on many different matters, largely inside Kyrgyzstan, although I first dealt
       extensively with Otunbayeva when she served as Kyrgyz ambassador in the United
       States.

       Assessment of Otunbayeva: The opposition forces selected Otunbayeva for several
       reasons: (i) among them she is the only figure who commands recognition and respect
       abroad; (ii) in the eyes of the Kyrgyz people she is closely associated with the Kyrgyz

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774839 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

       Tulip Revolution of 2005, yet she alone among the leaders of that revolution upheld its
      idealism, openly castigated Bakiyev and others for their corruption and failure to follow
      through on promises, and personally avoided corruption and graft; and (iii) she lacks a

      strong domestic power base and therefore is seen as less of a threat to the alternative
       candidates. Based on these factors, several of the opposition leaders tell me a quick
       consensus was reached that Otunbayeva should be the provisional leader and the "face to
      the world" of the new revolution.

      Otunbayeva, who is 59, launched her career in the diplomatic service, obtaining the

       position of foreign minister of the Kyrgyz SSR at a precocious age. She served in the
       Soviet Foreign Ministry and caught the eye of Eduard Shevardnadze, who appointed her
       as a vice minister—an unprecedented accomplishment for a Central Asian and for a
       woman then in her late 30s. Shevardnadze told me in 2002 that he had viewed
       Otunbayeva as a person of extraordinary skills, well qualified to succeed him as Soviet
       foreign minister. He noted her ability quickly to grasp complex problems and to propose

       novel and interesting solutions. He called her a "natural diplomat" with an instinctive
       tendency to reconcile, but also with a clear grasp of policy objectives and a methodical
       approach to their accomplishment. My own experience in dealing with Otunbayeva
       confirms these observations. She has a measure of idealism that often guides her policy
       orientation, but she is instinctively pragmatic in her approach.

       Otunbayeva defies categorization in terms of political philosophy. Her political parties,
       first Ata-Jurt ("Fatherland"), then the Social Democrats, are often portrayed as "leftists"
       on the political scale in Kyrgyzstan, but the party orients itself to continental European
       social democrats and to the British Labour Party (with which Otunbayeva has solid
       connections, including with Tony Blair). While schooled in basic concepts of Marxism-
       Leninism, which occasionally appear in conversation (though often as not in a joking

       way), her politics is fundamentally one of pragmatic engagement. She advocates
       maintenance of the republic's Soviet era social net and pays particular attention to health
       and education issues. She was a vigorous advocate for and supporter of the American
       University in Bishkek and was repeatedly identified for board membership—she declined
       one offer saying that her role as an opposition leader would probably complicate the
       university's relations with the government. As ambassador, Otunbayeva went to bat
       aggressively for foreign investors, helped them secure concessions, and advocated for

       them against government red tape. I am unaware of any instance in which she ever
       sought personal gain or advancement in connection with these deals, however. She is
       very unusual among Kyrgyz political figures in her rejection of rent-seeking and her loud
       denunciation of political figures who use their office for personal gain. Indeed, this
       aspect of her personality has won her some respect in the public, but general disdain
       among the political class, who frequently disparage her as "unrealistic."

       Otunbayeva served extended periods in Washington and London as the Kyrgyz
       ambassador. She has a fluent and subtle command of the English language, and a
       broadly positive view of the United States and the United Kingdom. Of the three Kyrgyz
       leaders to date, she is clearly the one with the deepest understanding of American culture
       and the American political environment and the one with the most instinctively pro-

      American leanings.
                                                                                                            1.4(D)
                                                                                                            B1
      Otunbayeva believes that for cultural, commercial and security reasons, a stable
      relationship between Bishkek and Moscow is a matter of primary concern.

      Her Position within the New Government. Opposition leaders with whom I have spoken
      expect that Bakiyev will resign, that the opposition will dissolve parliament and form a
      new interim government with Otunbayeva as its leader and that new elections will then
      soon be called first for president and then for a new parliament. Many of the opposition

      figures doubt that Otunbayeva can be a successful candidate for president especially
      given her weak performance in prior elections to parliament. Tekebayev is more broadly
      expected to emerge as their nominee. However, there is recognition that, Otunbayeva
      may, if she skillfully manages the transition period, develop the necessary popular basis
      and emerge as leader. It is stressed that her prospects increase as relations with foreign

      powers are seen as problematic, since she alone among the opposition figures is viewed
      as having the stature and skills necessary to cope with difficult foreign affairs problems.

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774839 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

       Opposition Relations With Bishkek Embassy.        Opposition leaders express a broadly
       positive view of U.S. ambassador Tatiana Gfoeller.

                                                                                                                    1.4(D)
                                                                                                                    B1

       One other fact is very important here: Otunbayeva herself is a professional diplomat.
       She will strongly prefer  to address these issues through diplomatic dialogue with other
       professional diplomats.
         	                                             All of this suggests to me the necessity for
       the State Department to assert itself and take the lead in developing relations with the

       new government.

On the morning of February 25, a former official of the government of Muammar

 concerned by the knowledge that the soldiers and officers assigned to the Libyan Army's

conventional high explosives, and launch random, but destructive attacks

against Benghazi, Tobruk or other towns under the control of anti-government forces.

(Source Comment: These sources repeated their earlier warning that Qaddafi would not

hesitate to use all of the resources at his disposal to attack civilian, political, and economic
targets if he feels he is on the verge of being defeated by anti-government troops.)

During the afternoon of February 25, Qaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam stated in private that his

father is convinced he can hold power, if he can maintain control of portions of Tripoli for the
next ten (10) days. Saif al-Islam states that it is important to remember that his father is still the

Head of State in Libya, and that the UN and the major nations of the world are reluctant to

depose a sitting Head of State. (Source Comment: The United States invasions of Iraq and

Afghanistan sere as the examples that prove the rule in this case.) The Libyan diplomats
serving abroad who remain loyal to Qaddafi have been instructed to press this point with other

governments. These diplomats are particularly active in sub Saharan African, and at this point

Saif al-Islam is pleased with what he considers the rather mild reaction of these states to the

violence used by forces loyal to Qaddafi in suppressing anti-government activities in

Libya. Saif al-Islam believes that while the leaders of countries like Chad, Benin, and Burkina
Faso must call for an end to violence, they will continue to stop short of statements supporting

the demonstrators. By the same token the Organization of African Unity (OAU), after delaying

its response to the violence for several days, has limited its statements to an expression of

concern.
The current President of the OAU is Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the President of

Equatorial Guinea, who, according to well placed sources, considers himself a friend and

supporter of Qaddafi. Mbasogo received support from Libya when he seized power in a violent

military coup d'etat in 1979, and he has remained loyal to Qaddafi over the years. Mbasogo
 receives technical and business advice from Libyan experts, particularly in managing Equatorial

 Guinea's substantial oil resources.

 Since coming to power in 1969 Qaddafi has worked to establish strong relationships with the

 Heads of State in many sub-Saharan African nations. This support has included technical and

        <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05779901 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

financial aid, military support, and private payments to the various Heads of State. According

to Saif al-Islam, Qaddfi believes these African states will now continue support him as he deals

with the rebellion in Libya. Well placed sources report that Mbasogo has received millions of
dollars in private payments from the Qaddafi regime.

Since 1969, Qaddafi has been one of the only Islamic leaders in North Africa to seek out cordial

relations with the nations of sub-Saharan Africa. According to a former official of the Kenyan

government, these African states feel that the Islamic nations of North Africa look down on

their southern neighbors and focus most their attention on relations with the Arab states of the
Middle East. Libya and Israel are the two countries of North Africa and the Middle East who

have invested substantial time, money and personnel resources in supporting these African

states. For its part, Kenya has a history of conflict with Libya rooted in the Cold War, however,

this individual notes that even these relations improved after the 2003-2004 Libyan agreement
with the Western powers regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction.

(Source Comment: The leaders of the OAU states also fear that the wave of anti-corruption

unrest that is sweeping North Africa will spread south. This is particularly true in the case of

dictators like Mbasogo and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe. However, even elected leaders like
South Africa's Jakob Zuma must be concerned because of the economic downturn in their

countries and the rampant corruption that exists across Africa. It is highly unlikely that these

African states will support any attempt by the UN, or NATO to organize some form of military

response to the Libyan situation, including the establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya.)

iiolence continues throughout Tripoli, with those military, and Para military units still loyal to
ddafi using deadly force against protesters. These forces are being supported by mercenaries

m the sub-Sahara Africa. The	         various tribal, civic and political groups continue to form

olutionary committees in an effort to begin to organize the parts of the country under the

itrol of anti-government forces. According to a former government official, these
nmittees are hoping that the international community will	       reach out to them and assist in

 Why P.J. Crowley went rogue
 April 18, 2011 06:26 PM EDT

 To friends, colleagues and even critics, there are few more unlikely candidates than P.J.

 Crowley to become a free speech martyr and a darling of the left. A veteran of three
 decades in the Air Force public affairs division, Crowley was a notoriously tight-lipped
 spokesman for the National Security Council during the Clinton administration and has
 been viewed for most his career as a guy who, above all, hates to make news.

 How to square that, then, with the Crowley who     lost his job as assistant Secretary of State
 last month by  characterizingWikileaks suspect Bradley Manning's treatment by the
 Pentagon as "ridiculous, counterproductive and stupid"? The Crowley who was given a

 chance by take those words back by Philippa Thomas, a BBC reporter on leave as a
 Nieman fellow at Harvard University, but answered, after a brief pause, when Thomas
 asked if was speaking on the record: "Sure."

 When Thomas reported Crowley's statement, some of his friends thought he'd acted on
 the flack's equivalent of a Freudian death wish, spontaneously combusting in the lab at
 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His critics in government, who'd long regarded
 himas too aggressive, even undisciplined, to speak fromthe State Department podium,

 viewed the statement as his latest gaffe.

 To Crowley, it was neither. It was just the latest step in his characteristically low-key
 decision to go a just a little bit rogue, the latest step in a career spokesman's realization
 that words can have real power.

 "When I paused and then agreed to have the remark on the record, I knew there was a
 dart that I was sending to the Pentagon," he said in a recent interview in the deserted bar

 of a Washington hotel

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05781379 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

Crowley didn't know for sure he would    lose his job the next day, he recalled, but he did
realize what he'd done.

"I knew it would get attention," he said.

And it did. Crowley might have kept his job, or at least found a softer landing, had

President Obama not been asked    about his comment 18 hours later at a news conference
and voiced full support of the Pentagon.

"When I understood that both the question had been posed to the President and he
answered it the way he did, and then there was ... what the White House staff thought of
the situation," he said. "I knew I had lost their trust and confidence and in that
circumstance I knew that I had to resign.*

Washington, D.C. is full of people one sentence, one tweet, one false — that is, true — word
away from ending their careers. A sarcastic comment about the boss, a passionate
statement on policy, or an insensitive status update — all can be fatal to everyone from a

member of Congress to a junior staffer at a public relations firm+.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton brought Crowley, 59, to the State Department in part

because he was viewed as someone who was virtually certain to make none of those
mistakes. Crowley had always seemed the soul of discretion, a spokesman so wedded to
the daily guidance during the Clinton White House years that reporters joked that he might
go on background if asked what the next day's weather forecast looked like.

But unbeknown to his new colleagues at State - and many of his old friends across
Washington - Crowley arrived at State after an evolution of sorts. The career Air Force
officer, who had entered a military establishment still scarred by the Vietnam War and still

deeply hostile to the press, spent his years in civilian life at the Center for American
Progress, thinking about strategy. There, some colleagues were surprised to find that his
politics seemed to have been shaped more, as one put it, by his native Massachusetts
than the Air Force. He settled on the idea of "strategic narrative," a concept that has made

its way into national security jargon from business theory, and one he included in a report
he wrote for CAR

At the State Department podium, Crowley seemed to find his voice and to also realize that

his voice could shape policy. "In the digital global age that we're in, our actions and our
words have greater impact. I knew that at the podium — that I would say something and
within a few hours, the message would be received somewhere else — and a response,"

he said. "That has impact, because on a regular basis, at the podium, I would challenge
the impact of other countries on the treatment of their own citizens, their treatment of
prisoners, on their treatment of the media."

And Crowley — to the occasional dismay of some of his colleagues at State and the White
House — had come to view himself as having a special public role.

"There were times when I thought it was important to push for the United States to take a

public stand," he said of his time at the podium. "I thought it was important to make sure
that what we were saying and what we were doing would be consistent with, not only our
interest but our values."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05781379 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

Behind the scenes at the State Department, he'd often argued for blunter, less diplomatic
talk. And he'd at times angered the White House and his colleagues by straying

dramatically from his official guidance, and positioning himself not just as a staid briefer
but as a combatant on the global stage.

"The Egyptian government can't reshuffle the deck and then stand pat," he warned in one

late January tweet that had not, officials said, been approved by the White House staffers
trying to manage the chaos of President Hosni Mubarak's last days.

In an earlier instance, when Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi called for a Jihad against
Switzerland last year, Crowley responded by mocking his lengthy speech at the United
Nations.

"'Lots of words and lots of papers flying all over the place, not necessarily a lot of sense,"
he said.

Qadhafi was, at the time, still a sometime partner of the United States, and Libyan
diplomats — and Crowley's own colleagues — were livid. He was forced to apologize.

"These comments do not reflect US policy and were not intended to offend," he said at

time. But in his interview last week with POLITICO, he was less repentant. "I was not
wrong. Maybe I wasn't diplomatic, but I was not wrong," Crowley said.

Even on the morning of his Manning remarks, Crowley had tweeted — and then deleted -

a comparison of the Japanese tsunami to the metaphorical "tsunami" sweeping the Middle
East and North Africa. He said he now regrets only deleting it, which he did because "my
staff thought that that was insensitive."

To the Obama Administration's careful national security team, these and other Crowley
comments were sloppy and infuriating. To Crowley, it was deliberate strategy in a job that
has, as he sees it, an institutional role beyond the demands of day-to-day politics.

"I view myself as a strategic thinker and always tried to put what I was saying at the
podium in a broader context and trying to always assess, will my words be credible?" he
said.

Crowley has stood by his blunt criticism of the Defense Department's treatment of
Manning, but it was the last straw, and the anger from the Pentagon and the White House
ensured his immediate departure.

And the State Department quietly put out word that he was on his way out with nothing to
lose, being pushed aside in favor of his deputy, Mike Hammer.

Neither of those claims is quite true. Crowley was indeed exhausted by his job and had
critics in the White House and rivals in Clinton's inner circle. But he'd been offered the
softest of landings, an ambassadorship, two senior Democrats said, a post the Manning
comments cost him.

And Crowley has no obvious successor in a post that has served as the latest illustration
of the quiet personnel wars that have long plagued Secretary Clinton. Crowley's tense
relationship with her longtime aide and former Senate spokesman, Philippe Reines,

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05781379 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

proved so problematic that hints of it made it into a draft inspector general's report that
also criticized Crowley's management. But the Assistant Secretary had been filling three
roles: He was the Assistant Secretary, but Clinton had failed to hire a Principal Deputy for
management after her first choice, Mary Ellen Glynn, fell through. Clinton had also been
looking for another spokesman to brief reporters daily, and Crowley had suggested former

Clinton White House and current State Department official Jonathan Prince, but no one
was ever hired to fill the post. State Department officials suggested when Crowley
departed that Hammer would permanently fill the post; now, two officials said, it appears
that he won't.

Some observers also believed, after Crowley's explosive exit, that he had made a clever
career move, positioning himself to leave government for a position as a hero of the left.
The anti-war group Code Pink even protested outside the State Department.

But Crowley himself turns a bit pink at the memory of that protest, leaning in and folding
his hands between his thighs out of evident embarrassment. Though he's made irregular

television appearances, he hasn't become a leader of the campaign to free Manning,
whomhe thinks "should spend a long long time in jail," though his pre-trial treatment was
undermining perceptions of the American legal system.

Crowley, for his part, plans to begin teaching, he said.

"I'mnot a larger than life person," he said. "I'mshort, bald and old."

This is what we're proposing to put out in your name. We've crafted the statement in a way that doesn't pronounce
definitively on what happened but is strong and tough. Can you take a look? (Sorry for the caps)

The United States condemns

in the strongest possible terms yesterday's massacre in the Syrian village of Haoula. United Nations observers have
confirmed that dozens of men, women, and children were killed and hundreds more wounded in a vicious assault that

involved a REGIME artillery and tank barrage on a residential neighborhood.

The world will spare no effort to IDENTIFY AND HOLD accountABLE THOSE who perpetrated this atrocity. And the
UNITED STATES will WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO intensify our pressure on Asad and his cronies,

whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end.

WE stand in solidarity with the Syrian people and the peaceful marchers in cities across Syria who have taken to the
streets to denounce the massacre in Haoula.

All-

Below is the statement for spox to release for after the flight goes wheels up. I will let you know when that happens. We anticipate

around 8:30pm. CA has reached out to HE1S who will be receiving the plane and they will help keep media away from the AmCits and
facilitate entry. Once they arrive in Miami it is up to them to get to their destination.

Thanks,

Today, the Haitian judge released eight of the ten American citizens and they have departed Haiti for the United
 States. Two members of the group are being detained in Haiti to answer further questions, as the investigation is

ongoing. The United State Government respects the sovereign right of the Government of Haiti to conduct its
own judicial processes. The United States Embassy in Port au Prince has been providing the detained
 Americans with consular visits and assistance to ensure that they are safe and receiving necessary care. Haitian

 authorities have been cooperative in ensuring the individuals' safety and welfare since their arrest and we have
 every expectation this will continue.

</span>

BRUSSELS - Despite months of preparation and strenuous international diplomacy, the talks boiled down to an inability
of the world's two largest emitters, the United States and China, to agree on headline fixed targets.

The 27 member states of the EU had gone into the talks with a unified position and with a plan for financing emissions
cuts in the developing world, with a commitment to spend around 7 billion euros ($10.01 billion) over the next three

years to aid poorer countries.
But those aims were largely sidelined as the talks failed to produce the breakthrough agreement many had hoped for.

"Europe never lost its aim, never, never came to splits or different positions, but of course this was mainly about other
countries really (being) unwilling, and especially the United States and China," said Carlgren.

Britain on Monday blamed China and a handful of other countries of holding the world to ransom by blocking a legally
binding treaty at Copenhagen, stepping up a blame game that has gathered momentum since the talks ended.

Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the summit as "at best flawed and at worst chaotic" and demanded an urgent
reform of the process to try to reach a legal treaty when talks are expected to resume in Germany next June.

But Danish Climate Minister Connie Hedegaard, who quit as president of the Copenhagen talks midway through after
being criticised by African countries for favouring wealthier nations in negotiations, said it was no time to get depressed

about the process of tackling climate change.
"What we need to do is to secure the step that we took and turn it into a result," she told reporters as she arrived for

the Brussels meeting on Tuesday. Asked whether Copenhagen had been a failure, she replied:
"It would have been a failure if we had achieved nothing. But we achieved something. A first step. It was the first time

we held a process where all the countries were present, including the big emitters."

'Inept' US cannot fix Afghanistan: top Saudi prince Sun, May 16, 2010

RIYADH (AFP) — An "inept" United States cannot fix Afghanistan's problems and should simply focus on "chasing the
terrorists" there, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said on Saturday.

The ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle East

peace talks, and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free.

AFP — Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ...

In a speech in Riyadh before diplomats, Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people and
had no hope of rebuilding the country.

"What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists," Turki told the Arab

 News conference.

 US President Barack Obama "should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan's ills by military
 means."

"Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, arrest them or kill them, and get out, and let the

 Afghan people deal with their problems.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770551 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

"As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil, they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideological

mercenaries."

Turki, who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington's handling of relations with

Kabul.

"The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement.

"Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths," he said. "How can they both get out of that
situation? I don't know."

The chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies, Turki has no official position but is believed to

often reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government.

He is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and analysts speculate he could become foreign minister
when Saud retires.

Turki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.

"The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done," said Turki.

"It is not enough to talk the talk. He has to walk the walk.

"If he does not succeed... then I (will) ask President Obama to do the morally decent gesture and recognise the

Palestinian state that he so ardently wishes to exist.

"He can then pack up and leave us in peace and let the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese negotiate directly with the
Israelis. No more platitudes and good wishes and visions, please."

Turki also faulted the US and European approach in trying to halt Iran's alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon.

"The discussions on Iran's nuclear ambitions started off on the wrong foot. The carrot and stick approach does not

work," he said.

For one, he said, the US and Europe have had double-standards in dealing with Iran on the one hand, and other nuclear
countries on the other.

"You cannot ask Iran to play on one level while you allow Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea to play on other levels."

Turki said a successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness, a "universal nuclear security umbrella" for the

countries in the area, and "a good military option" against any regional country which does not cooperate.

 He said Clinton had undermined efforts to move toward a regional nuclear-free zone, after the UN Security Council's five
 permanent members recently expressed support for the idea.

"Alas... Clinton then voided the issue of its value by stating that the conditions do not yet exist for establishing the zone,"

 he said.

 "Why, then, did she join the other members of the PS in issuing their statement?"

 Turki said he hoped Obama "will find the way to correct his secretary of state's nullification of making our area free of
 weapons of mass destruction."

Turki also warned of rising violence in Iraq after the pullout of US troops next year, warning both internal and external

groups seek to carve up the country.

"Imagine what will happen once internal strife and fighting escalates" following the US pullout, he said.

Without a UN Security Council effort to protect Iraq's current borders, the consequence could be "regional conflict on a
scale not seen since the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 17th and 18th centuries," he warned.

This is what we're proposing to put out in your name. We've crafted the statement in a way that doesn't pronounce
definitively on what happened but is strong and tough. Can you take a look? (Sorry for the caps)

The United States condemns

in the strongest possible terms yesterday's massacre in the Syrian village of Haoula. United Nations observers have
confirmed that dozens of men, women, and children were killed and hundreds more wounded in a vicious assault that

involved a REGIME artillery and tank barrage on a residential neighborhood.

The world will spare no effort to IDENTIFY AND HOLD accountABLE THOSE who perpetrated this atrocity. And the
 UNITED STATES will WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO intensify our pressure on Asad and his cronies,

 whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end.

 WE stand in solidarity with the Syrian people and the peaceful marchers in cities across Syria who have taken to the
 streets to denounce the massacre in Haoula.

             Dear Mr. Chairman:

                   I am asking your help in supporting the State and,USAID budget request kw

             FY 2011. I appreciate the difficult budget environment that confronts the
             Congress, but 1 strongly believe this budget request is critical to advancing U.S.
             national security and our interests around the world.

                   Our request totals $52.8 billion — a $4.9 billion increase over 2010. 01 that
             increase, $3.6 billion goes directly to "frontline states" — Afghanistan, Pakistan,
             and Iraq. All other State and USA1D funding grows by $1.3 billion or a 2.7
                                                                       problems of

'Inept' US cannot fix Afghanistan: top Saudi prince Sun, May 16, 2010

RIYADH (AFP) — An "inept" United States cannot fix Afghanistan's problems and should simply focus on "chasing the
terrorists" there, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said on Saturday.

The ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle East

peace talks, and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free.

AFP — Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ...

In a speech in Riyadh before diplomats, Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people and
had no hope of rebuilding the country.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770554 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

 "What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists," Turki told the Arab
News conference.

US President Barack Obama "should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan's ills by military

means."

"Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, arrest them or kill them, and get out, and let the
Afghan people deal with their problems.

"As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil, they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideological

mercenaries."

Turki, who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington's handling of relations with
Kabul.

"The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement.

"Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths," he said. "How can they both get out of that

situation? I don't know."

The chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies, Turki has no official position but is believed to
often reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government.

He is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and analysts speculate he could become foreign minister

when Saud retires.

Turki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.

"The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done," said Turki.

"It is not enough to talk the talk. He has to walk the walk.

"If he does not succeed... then I (will) ask President Obama to do the morally decent gesture and recognise the
Palestinian state that he so ardently wishes to exist.

"He can then pack up and leave us in peace and let the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese negotiate directly with the

Israelis. No more platitudes and good wishes and visions, please."

Turki also faulted the US and European approach in trying to halt Iran's alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon.

"The discussions on Iran's nuclear ambitions started off on the wrong foot. The carrot and stick approach does not
work," he said.

For one, he said, the US and Europe have had double-standards in dealing with Iran on the one hand, and other nuclear

countries on the other.

"You cannot ask Iran to play on one level while you allow Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea to play on other levels."

Turki said a successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness, a "universal nuclear security umbrella" for the
countries in the area, and "a good military option" against any regional country which does not cooperate.

He said Clinton had undermined efforts to move toward a regional nuclear-free zone, after the UN Security Council's five

permanent members recently expressed support for the idea.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770554 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

"Alas... Clinton then voided the issue of its value by stating that the conditions do not yet exist for establishing the zone,"
he said.

"Why, then, did she join the other members of the P5 in issuing their statement?"

Turki said he hoped Obama "will find the way to correct his secretary of state's nullification of making our area free of

weapons of mass destruction."

Turki also warned of rising violence in Iraq after the pullout of US troops next year, warning both internal and external
groups seek to carve up the country.

"Imagine what will happen once internal strife and fighting escalates" following the US pullout, he said.

Without a UN Security Council effort to protect Iraq's current borders, the consequence could be "regional conflict on a

scale not seen since the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 17th and 18th centuries," he warned.

Background on the Women Deliver Conference CONTEXT The second Women Deliver conference will take place in

Washington, DC on June 7-9, 2010. This conference is an international gathering that focuses on maternal health and
will include an estimated 3,000 representatives from governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, and the

private sector. The aim of the conference is to generate political commitment and financial investment for fulfilling
Millennium Development Goal 5, which pledges a three-quarter reduction in maternal mortality and universal access to

reproductive health by 2015. The conference is one of several international gatherings this year that will include a focus
on maternal and child health (MCH). As you know, this issue will also feature at the G-8, where the Canadians are

offering a flagship initiative on MCH, and at the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September, where the UN
Secretary General is sponsoring a Joint Effort on Women and Children's Health. The US will be represented at the

Women Deliver conference by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, Undersecretary of State Maria
Otero, Ambassador Melanne Verveer, and a host of other USG participants. Please note: You recently recorded a video

message that will open the conference.
The full script is below.

SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS
•    For too long and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result,

childbirth remains a leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. •	     The United States has elevated the
issue of maternal health in our development work through the Global Health Initiative, a $63 billion dollar proposal to

help countries improve health outcomes through strengthened health systems and integrated service delivery, with a
particular focus on the health of women, newborns and children.	       This conference—along with other international

gatherings this year, including the G-8 and the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September—presents a unique
opportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health. •	      When women prosper, their families and

communities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them. ADDITIONAL
BACKGROUND The theme of this year's Women Deliver conference is "Delivering Solutions for Girls and Women," with a

focus on political, economic, social/cultural, and technological solutions. Conference organizers plan to emphasize the
following messages:1) The Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved without investing in

women.2) There is just enough time, if the world commits funding now, to achieve Millennium Development Goal 5—
an additional US $10 billion annually by 2010 and US $20 billion by 2015.Women Deliver was launched at a conference

in London in 2007. Jill Sheffield is the President of the organization.

FINAL VIDEO SCRIPT WOMEN DELIVER CONFERENCEWASHINGTON, DC

I am delighted to welcome all of you to this conference and to thank you for the work you are doing to put maternal
health at the top of our development agenda. Your commitment to this issue has raised awareness and inspired action

around the world. We know that women represent our greatest opportunity for progress in this century. If the potential
of women is fully developed, everyone benefits. And this can't be done without improving maternal health. But for too

long and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result, childbirth remains
a leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. The United States has elevated this issue in our development

work through the Global Health Initiative, a 63 billion dollar proposal to help countries improve health outcomes
through strengthened health systems, with a particular focus on the health of women, newborns and children. We

commend the Canadian government for focusing much-needed attention to this issue by offering a flagship initiative on
maternal and child health at the upcoming G-8 meeting in Muskoka. The US also congratulates the United Nations

Secretary General for convening governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, foundations and corporations to
engage in a much-needed global effort to promote women's and children's health. These efforts—and this conference—

present a unique opportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health, because when women prosper, their
families and communities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them. Thank you.

As definitive as I've ever seen the Russians in public...

Germany, Russia: We support new Iran nuke sanction By VERENA SCHMITT-ROSCHMANN, Associated Press Writer –
1 hr 58 mins ago

MESEBERG, Germany – Germany and Russia declared Saturday that the five world powers negotiating with Iran support

a fresh set of international sanctions, and Chancellor Angela Merkel said they could pass soon.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said at a news conference with Merkel that "agreement on the sanctions exists,"
despite the fact that "nobody wants sanctions."

"We hope the voice of the international community will be heard by the Iranian leadership," Medvedev said through the

official German translator.

Merkel said sanctions could be passed by the United Nations Security Council "in the near future."

"I am very happy, that we can stand here jointly today and say that this is a joint position not only of the European
Union, the United States of America and Russia, but also of China," Merkel said. "That is an important step the

international community has made here."

Moscow has recently joined the other four U.N. Security Council members — the United States, China, Britain and
France — to tentatively back a draft fourth set of U.N. sanctions against Iran.

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769675 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

"We have always taken a two-way approach, making offers, on the one hand, but, as there are no qualitative changes,
on the other hand now the time has come that such sanctions must be adopted," Merkel said.

Medvedev said it is unacceptable "that one continues to act irresponsibly. One has to move toward the partners of the

international community and it is only in this way that complicated issues can be solved."

Russia's president arrived Friday for a two-day visit to Germany to discuss a range of issues with Merkel.

The West is against an expansion of nuclear nations and suspects Iran is enriching uranium to build a nuclear warhead.
Tehran denies this and insists on its right to a peaceful nuclear power program, but has frustrated the West over its

failure to prove it.

Below are two documents: One is a memo from
	           who served in the counter-insurgency program in Vietnam with John Paul Vann. He writes about

Bernard Fall, the great French journalist and analyst, whom he studied with. His memo is a critique of COIN
proposals and his own recommendations.

The other document consists of notes from my conversation with William Murray, former station chief of CIA
in Pakistan. He was one of the members of a small CIA team, including Milt Bearden (whom you probably
know and who is close to Richard Holbrooke), that directed the Afghan resistance to the Soviet occupation.

Murray also served as station chief elsewhere, including Lebanon. His remarks focus on the lack of a clear
mission and message in Afghanistan.

Counterinsurgency — a much failed strategy?

Bernard Fall was one of the most significant theoreticians and practitioner of Counterinsurgency (COIN) in the

20th Century. He was the expert most listened to at the Special Warfare Center at Ft. Bragg when LTG William
Yarborough commanded the school there in the Kennedy and Johnson eras.

Fall defined COIN clearly. He said that: Counterinsurgency = political reform + economic development +
counter guerrilla operations

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765722 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

This theory of warfare was developed by the colonial powers as a "cure" for the wave on "wars of national
liberation" that swept through their overseas possessions after World War Two. Because of these revolts
against authority most of the European powers found themselves faced with colonized populations engaged in
extended attempts to obtain independence from the metropole. Such rebellions were usually based on ethnic
and racial differences with the colonizers and were often led by vanguard Left parties with communist

connections. That connection caused an eventual American policy commitment to the COIN struggle. That
commitment sometimes occurred as a partner of the colonial power (Vietnam in the late '40s and '50s) and
sometimes as a successor to the colonial power after at least partial independence had bee achieved. (Vietnam
after the French)

COIN theory was seen by both the former colonial officers who taught it at Bragg and their American disciples
of the time as the opposite of the methods of the anti-colonial insurgents who were thought to practice
something called "revolutionary warfare." (RW)

Revolutionary Warfare + Political subversion (including propaganda) + economic transformation (usually
socialist) + guerilla warfare (to include terrorism)

The central idea behind COIN was seen as competitive reformed government and economic development for
the population that was at least potentially supported the insurgents RW movement. It was believed that if this
population was "protected" from the RW efforts of the insurgent movement, then the population would choose
to side with the counterinsurgents whether the counterinsurgents were the local post-colonial government or an
occupying power.

This doctrine was widely applied across the world in the middle and late 20thCentury. There were successes
and there were failures.

Successes:

The British suppression of the "Malayan Emergency" was probably the greatest success of the

counterinsurgents. In Malaya the British colonial authorities faced a clearly communist guerrilla movement that
consisted altogether of overseas Chinese living in the midst of a majority Malay and Muslim population. The
area of operations was a peninsula nearly completely surrounded by ocean areas dominated by the British
Navy. The British forces suffered from cross department coordination issues early in the campaign, but once
those were solved and the "Communist Terrorists" (CTs) isolated in the jungles and rubber plantations all that
was needed to defeat them was persistence in small unit patrolling until the CTs were exterminated. There were
never more than a few hundred of them. The British succeeded in suppressing this revolt but what did this

successful effort cost them. It was enormously expensive and success was followed by British withdrawal from
Malaya and the creation of an independent Malaysia completely dominated by the Malay ethnic adversaries of
the overseas Chinese.

 Kenya and Cyprus were both gripped by revolts by the Kikuyu and Greek populations respectively. In both
cases, RW campaigns based on terrorism were fought to a standstill by the British only to be followed by

political decisions on the part of the British government to abandon these countries and allow the ascent to
power of the former leaders of the insurgencies, Kenyatta and Makarios respectively.

In Latin America, where I participated in several COIN efforts, the Kennedy created "Alliance for Progress"
sought to defeat local insurgencies inspired and led by cadres from Castro's Cuba. These countries were
particularly good targets for communist inspired RW because the political and economic structures of the

Central American and Andean states were so clearly unfair and un-democratic that local populations of
underfed Indians and peasants could be easily proselytized In the process of RW. In many cases in Latin
America the low level economic development efforts of the civil and military arms of the US Government met
with considerable success. Villagers were protected from the insurgents, local (village economies) were

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765722 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

 improved. Medical treatment was provided to those who had never known it. Nevertheless, the "Alliance for
 Progress" can not be considered a strategic success. Why? The local elites in all these countries quickly
 perceived the COIN campaign as a threat to their political privilege and wealth in land and simply refused to
 institute the reforms sponsored by the alliance. Much the same thing happened in various parts of Africa and

 Southwest Asia where it was attempted.

 Failures

•The American war in Vietnam is a typical example of failure of the COIN theory. The massive communist led

 Viet Minh independence movement was a classic example of RW in all its components taken to its ultimate
 development in the creation of a regular army for the insurgent movement under the sponsorship of its Chinese
 communist ally. The United States participated in the French COIN effort against the Viet Minh and then
 became the sponsor of the post-colonial government left behind by the French on their departure. Contrary to
 popular legend (I served there for two years) the initial approach of the United States to the situation in South
 Vietnam was pure COIN right out of the Ft. Bragg School. Populations of villagers were protected, the South

 Vietnamese armed forces were developed, village militias were created for self defense, good government was
 preached to the Diem government in Saigon. Economic development was fostered. It was only when the
 government of North Vietnam decided that these methods were a serious bar to their eventual success in RW in
 the South and brought its regular army into South Vietnam in 1964 that US forces escalated their own
 deployment to the conventional war level. This was a necessary step if the eradication of the South Vietnamese
 government and the US COIN effort was to be avoided. There followed three years of conventional warfare

 between US and North Vietnamese forces. This warfare was largely conducted outside populated areas. COIN
 efforts continued during this period but took second place to the need to defeat or at least seriously weaken
 North Vietnam's army. In 1967 it was judged that this had been accomplished and COIN was once again made
 the centerpiece of American efforts in Vietnam. To accomplish this, a fully integrated civil/military COIN
 structure was created under the combined military command in Vietnam. This was called "Civil Operations,
 Revolutionary Development Support." (CORDS) I worked in this program for a year. (1968-1969) This effort
 had virtually unlimited money, ten thousand advisers in every aspect of Vietnamese civil society, business and

 government function and a massive coalition and south Vietnamese conventional force standing by to protect
 the population and the counterinsurgents of CORDS while they did their work. This COIN program was largely
 successful. A handover to the South Vietnamese forces was devised in the form of the "Vietnamization
 Program" and US forces were withdrawn in "trenches" (slices) over a couple of years. Following the
 Christmas, 1972 renewed bombing effort over North Vietnam (caused by North Vietnamese intransigence in
 Geneva) a ceasefire was reached and for two years there was quiet in South Vietnam with the South Vietnamese

 government holding much of the country. It was only after some minor incident on the world stage caused a
 revulsion in the American press and public against any further involvement in Vietnam that the US Congress
 passed a law forbidding any further aid to South Vietnam that the North Vietnamese decided to use their fine
 army to over run the country in a conventional war. Lesson — You can win the COIN war and still be defeated
 conventionally or politically at home.

 The French war in Algeria is another example of COIN success followed by political defeat and
 withdrawal. After a prolonged struggle, the French security force had largely defeated the Algerian native
 guerrillas of the Front National de Liberation (FLN). This struggle had been waged with all the aspects of
 classic COIN doctrine. The revolt had started in 1955. By 1960 the French Army, police and their Algerian
 allies had largely won the fight. As in Vietnam, two years then passed in relative quiet. In 1962 De Gaulle was
 elected president of France with a political vision that required independence for Algeria. That negated all the

 struggle and success of the CIIN war. Failure once again at the strategic level.

 Our war in Iraq is now cited as an example of the success of the COIN theory and its methods. In fact nothing
 of the sort occurred in Iraq. Remember — COIN = political reform + economic development + counter-guerilla

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765722 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

operations. We have not brought on political reform in Iraq. What we have done is re-arrange the "players" in
such a way that the formerly downtrodden Shia Arabs are now the masters. This has in no way reduced the
potential for inter-communal armed struggle. We did not defeat the insurgents in counter guerrilla
operations. What we did was bring more troops into the Baghdad area to enforce the separation of the ethno-

sectarian communities while at the same time using traditional methods of "divide and conquer" to split off
enough insurgents to form an effective force to use against Al-Qa'ida in Iraq and others whom we disapproved
of. This is not counterinsurgency!!!

Conclusion

COIN is a badly flawed instrument of statecraft: Why?

- The locals ultimately own the country being fought over. If they do not want the "reforms" you desire, they
will resist you as we have been resisted in Iraq and Afghanistan. McChrystal's strategy paper severely

criticized Karzai's government. Will that disapproval harden into a decision to act to find a better government
or will we simply undercut Afghan central government and become the actual government?

- Such COIN wars are expensive, long drawn out affairs that are deeply debilitating for the foreign
counterinsurgent power. Reserves of money, soldiers and national will are not endless. Ultimately, the body
politic of the counterinsurgent foreign power turns against the war and then all that has occurred has been a

waste.

- COIN theory is predicated on the ability of the counterinsurgents to change the mentality of the "protected"
(read controlled) population. The sad truth is that most people do not want to be deprived of their ancestral
ways and will fight to protect them. "Hearts and Minds" is an empty propagandist's phrase.

- In the end the foreign counterinsurgent is embarked on a war that is not his own war. For him, the COIN war
will always be a limited war, fought for a limited time with limited resources. For the insurgent, the war is total
war. They have no where to escape to after a tour of duty. The psychological difference is massive.

- For the counterinsurgent the commitment of forces must necessarily be much larger than for the
insurgents. The counterinsurgent seeks to protect massive areas, hundreds of built up areas and millions of

people. The insurgent can pick his targets. The difference in force requirements is crippling to the
counterinsurgents.

What should we do?

- Hold the cities as bases to prevent a recognized Taliban government until some satisfactory (to us) deal is
made among the Afghans.

- Participate in international economic development projects for Afghanistan.

- Conduct effective clandestine HUMINT out of the city bases against international jihadi elements.

- Turn the tribes against the jihadi elements.

- Continue to hunt and kill/capture dangerous jihadis,

How long might you have to follow this program? It might be a long time but that would be sustainable. A

full-blown COIN campaign in Afghanistan is not politically sustainable.

Bill Murray
11/12/09

There was a small group of us (CIA) who ran the war against the Soviets, about five of us. I was station chief in
Pakistan from 1991-94. We were criticized by State for supporting the extremists. We always said we are only
there to support those who fight. Our logic was that we had no political goal, just get the Soviets out. We should

have demobilized the Afghans, but we didn't.

Our goals were understood by the Afghans. We stuck to the message.

The Afghanis hated the Arabs, hated them during the war against the Soviets. It's mythology they liked them,
built by the press. You can't get the press to get off the blowback theory. Bin Laden, I doubt if he ever fired a

gun in anger. He was there when I was there. He was engineering projects, roads, bridges and medical teams.
But there was no big Arab fighting force.

Milt Bearden and I met with Pakistani generals who contacted us in 2007 at their request, met with the key
general from ISI who created the Taliban. The message to us was that the Brits shouldn't go into Helmand.
They had thrown them out in 1880 and they would never accept them back. No one listened. I'm in contact with

those people all the time. So is Milt. They don't believe us anymore. The US military has its own objective.
They think we are fighting against Islam. The Afghanis will never perceive we are a secular society.

The military reinforces the same things over and over again. We're literally fighting the people.
The problem is not the number of troops. It's a failed mission. The Afghanis believe we are there to stay. That is
the thing they will never accept. They will allow armies to go through and even stay for a few years, but not

stay forever. I pity the president on his choices. He's torn by the military, with their typical just-give-us-the-
troops. I don't see how to make this work.

We need a clear mission, internationalize the message and set an attainable goal. The message should be: No
place should be a sanctuary for a group that threatens the peace of the international community. There needs to
be a clearly defined goal. We went there to get al Qaeda and get Bin Laden. We didn't go there to get the
Taliban. We've shifted goals and we're trying to build a government in Afghanistan with a person who

represents a small portion of the people and is corrupt.

To me the message would be, we came to get AQ, this place can never a launch pad for terrorism against the
West. Say we'll be out four months after we get Bin Laden. The Taliban are telling people we are there to stay
forever. We talk about democracy, etc. They don't care. They care about the way of life. It's as simplistic as it
gets. We can't afford to restructure that society.

McChrystal is a military commander. He is going to solve the problem with more troops. We are exactly where
the Soviets were in '86. We are hunkered down in large encampments, we sweep down, they lure us into
ambushes.

The problem is not the number of troops. It's a failed mission. We don't talk about Bin Laden anymore. We've

never declared our objectives in a way the Afghan people understand. Too much talk about democracy and
nation building. Obama should say we're here to get the people who distrub the international peace. I'd
internationalize it. This is the whole world's problem. The AQ is a plague. What we want to achieve is the
destruction of AQ and then we'll withdraw.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765722 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

You can make a deal they won't support AQ figures in the future.

In Pakistan, it's hopeless. I sat in on every discusssion on the decision that led to cutting off aid in 1990. There

was no doubt of what they were doing. Never once did a single Pakistani official deviate from saying that they
were not making nuclear weapons. Every discussion began with a lie.

I would close every Indian consulate all over Afghanistan. The Pakistanis believe they are funding the Taliban.

The US Diplomatic Leaks

A Superpower's View of the World

By SPIEGEL Staff

251,000 State Department documents, many of them secret embassy reports from around the world,

show how the US seeks to safeguard its influence around the world. It is nothing short of a political

meltdown for US foreign policy.

What does the United States really think of German Chancellor Angela Merkel? Is she a reliable ally? Did she really
make an effort to patch up relations with Washington that had been so damaged by her predecessor? At most, it was

a half-hearted one.

The tone of trans-Atlantic relations may have improved, former US Ambassador to Germany William Timken wrote in

a cable to the State Department at the end of 2006, but the chancellor "has not taken bold steps yet to improve the
substantive content of the relationship." That is not exactly high praise.

And the verdict on German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle? His thoughts "were short on substance," wrote the

 current US ambassador in Berlin, Philip Murphy, in a cable. The reason, Murphy suggested, was that "Westerwelle's

 command of complex foreign and security policy issues still requires deepening."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771872 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

Such comments are hardly friendly. But in the eyes of the American diplomatic corps, every actor is quickly

categorized as a friend or foe. King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia? A friend: Abdullah can't stand his neighbors in Iran and,

expressing his disdain for the mullah regime, said, "there is no doubt something unstable about them." And his ally,
Sheikh bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi? Also a friend. He believes "a near term conventional war with Iran is clearly

preferable to the long term consequences of a nuclear armed Iran."

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emissaries also learn of a special "Iran observer" in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku
who reports on a dispute that played out during a meeting of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. An enraged

Revolutionary Guard Chief of Staff Mohammed Ali Jafari allegedly got into a heated argument with Mahmoud

Ahmadinejad and slapped him in the face because the generally conservative president had, surprisingly, advocated

freedom of the press.

A Political Meltdown

                                                                                                            New York
Such surprises from the annals of US diplomacy will dominate the headlines in the coming days when the
                            Paris'Le Monde,  Madrid's El Pais and SPIEGEL begin shedding light on the treasure trove of
Times, London's  Guardian,
secret documents from the State Department. Included are 243,270 diplomatic cables filed by US embassies to the

State Department and 8,017 directives that the State Department sent to its diplomatic outposts around the world. In

the coming days, the participating media will show in a series of investigative stories how America seeks to steer the

world. The development is no less than a political meltdown for American foreign policy.

Never before in history has a superpower lost control of such vast amounts of such sensitive information -- data that

 can help paint a picture of the foundation upon which US foreign policy is built. Never before has the trust America's
 partners have in the country been as badly shaken. Now, their own personal views and policy recommendations have

 been made public -- as have America's true views of them.

 For example, one can learn that German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the Germany's most beloved
 politician according to public opinion polls, openly criticizes fellow cabinet member Guido Westerwelle in conversations

 with US diplomats, and even snitches on him. Or that Secretary of State Clinton wants her ambassadors in Moscow

 and Rome to inform her whether there is anything to the rumors that Italian President Silvio Berlusconi and Vladimir

 Putin have private business ties in addition to their close friendship -- whispers that both have vehemently denied.

 America's ambassadors can be merciless in their assessments of the countries in which they are stationed. That's their

 job. Kenya? A swamp of flourishing corruption extending across the country. Fifteen high-ranking Kenyan officials are

 already banned from traveling to the United States, and almost every single sentence in the embassy reports speaks

 with disdain of the government of President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga.

 Weighing Public Interest against Confidentiality

 Turkey hardly comes away any less scathed in the cables. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the cables allege,

 governs with the help of a cabal of incompetent advisors. Ankara Embassy officials depict a country on a path to an

 Islamist future -- a future that likely won't include European Union membership.

 As with the close to 92,000 documents on the war in Afghanistan at the end of July and the almost 400,000

 documents on the Iraq war recently released, the State Department cables have also been leaked to the WikiLeaks

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771872 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

whistleblower platform -- and they presumably came from the same source. As before, WikiLeaks has provided the

material to media partners to review and analyze them.

With a team of more than 50 reporters and researchers, SPIEGEL has viewed, analyzed and vetted the mass of

documents. In most cases, the magazine has sought to protect the identities of the Americans' informants, unless the

person who served as the informant was senior enough to be politically relevant. In some cases, the US government
expressed security concerns and SPIEGEL accepted a number of such objections. In other cases, however, SPIEGEL

felt the public interest in reporting the news was greater than the threat to security. Throughout our research,

SPIEGEL reporters and editors weighed the public interest against the justified interest of countries in security and

confidentiality.

It is now possible to view many political developments around the world through the lens of those who participated in

those events. As such, our understanding of those events is deeply enriched. That alone is often enough to place

transparency ahead of national regulations regarding confidentiality.

Following the leaks of military secrets from Afghanistan and Iraq, these leaks now put US diplomats on the hot seat. It

is the third coup for WikiLeaks within six months, and it is one that is likely to leave Washington feeling more than a

bit exposed. Around half of the cables that have been obtained aren't classified and slightly less, 40.5 percent, as

classified as "confidential." Six percent of the reports, or 16,652 cables, are labelled as "secret;" and of those, 4,330
are so explosive that they are labelled "NOFORN," meaning access should not be made available to non-US nationals.

Taken together, the cables provide enough raw text to fill 66 years worth of weekly SPIEGEL magazines.

Gossip and the Unvarnished Truth

Much in the material was noted and sent because those compiling the reports or their dialogue partners believed, with

some certainty, that their transcripts would not be made public for the next 25 years. That may also explain why the
ambassadors and emissaries from Washington were so willing to report gossip and hearsay back to State Department

headquarters. One cable from the Moscow Embassy on Russian first lady Svetlana Medvedev, for example, states that

 she is "generating tensions between the camps and remains the subject of avid gossip." It then goes on to report that

 President Medvedev's wife had already drawn up a list of officials who should be made to "suffer" in their careers

 because they had been disloyal to Medvedev. Another reports that the wife of Azerbaijan leader Ilham Aliyev has had
 so much plastic surgery that it is possible to confuse her for one of her daughters from a distance, but that she can

 barely still move her face.

 What makes the documents particularly appealing, though, is that many politicians speak the unvarnished truth,
 confident as they are that their musings will never be made public.

 What, though, do the thousands of documents prove? Do they really show a US which has the world on a leash? Are
 Washington's embassies still self-contained power centers in their host countries?

 In sum, probably not. In the major crisis regions, an image emerges of a superpower that can no longer truly be

 certain of its allies -- like in Pakistan, where the Americans are consumed by fear that the unstable nuclear power
 could become precisely the place where terrorists obtain dangerous nuclear material.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771872 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

There are similar fears in Yemen, where the US, against its better judgement, allows itself to be instrumentalized by

an unscrupulous leader. With American military aid that was intended for the fight against al-Qaida, Ali Abdullah Saleh

is now able to wage his battle against enemy tribes in the northern part of the country.

Insult to Injury

Even after the fall of Saddam Hussein, it still remained a challenge for the victorious power to assert its will on Iraq.

In Baghdad, which has seen a series of powerful US ambassadors -- men the international press often like to refer to

as American viceroys -- it is now up to Vice President Joe Biden to make repeated visits to allied Iraqi politicians in an

effort to get them to finally establish a respectable democracy. But the embassy cables make it very clear that

Obama's deputy has made little headway.

Instead, the Americans are forced to endure the endless tirades of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarek, who claims to

have always known that the Iraq war was the "biggest mistake ever committed" and who advised the Americans to

"forget about democracy in Iraq." Once the US forces depart, Mubarak said, the best way to ensure a peaceful
transition is for there to be a military coup. They are statements that add insult to injury.

On the whole, the cables from the Middle East expose the superpower's weaknesses. Washington has always viewed it

as vital to its survival to secure its share of energy reserves, but the world power is often quickly reduced to becoming
a plaything of diverse interests. And it is drawn into the animosities between Arabs and Israelis, Shiites and Sunnis,

between Islamists and secularists, between despots and kings. Often enough, the lesson of the documents that have

now been obtained, is that the Arab leaders use their friends in Washington to expand their own positions of power.

Editor's note: DER SPIEGEL's full reporting on the WikiLeaks US diplomatic cables will be published first in

the German-language edition of the magazine, which will be available on Monday to subscribers and at

newsstands in Germany and Europe. SPIEGEL ONLINE International will publish extended excerpts of

SPIEGEL's reporting in English in a series that will launch on Monday.

       'Inept' US cannot fix Afghanistan: top Saudi prince Sun, May 16, 2010

       RIYADH (AFP) — An "inept" United States cannot fix Afghanistan's problems and should simply focus on "chasing the

       terrorists" there, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said on Saturday.

       The ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle East
       peace talks, and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free.

       AFP — Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ...

       In a speech in Riyadh before diplomats, Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people and

   •   had no hope of rebuilding the country.

       "What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists," Turki told the Arab
       News conference.

       US President Barack Obama "should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan's ills by military

       means."

       "Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, arrest them or kill them, and get out, and let the
       Afghan people deal with their problems.

       "As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil, they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideological

       mercenaries."

       Turki, who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington's handling of relations with
       Kabul.

       "The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement.

       "Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths," he said. "How can they both get out of that

       situation? I don't know."

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775701 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

The chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies, Turki has no official position but is believed to

often reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government.

He is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and analysts speculate he could become foreign minister
when Saud retires.

Turki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.

"The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done," said Turki.

"It is not enough to talk the talk. He has to walk the walk.

"If he does not succeed... then I (will) ask President Obama to do the morally decent gesture and recognise the

Palestinian state that he so ardently wishes to exist.

"He can then pack up and leave us in peace and let the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese negotiate directly with the
Israelis. No more platitudes and good wishes and visions, please."

Turki also faulted the US and European approach in trying to halt Iran's alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon.

"The discussions on Iran's nuclear ambitions started off on the wrong foot. The carrot and stick approach does not

work," he said.

For one, he said, the US and Europe have had double-standards in dealing with Iran on the one hand, and other nuclear
countries on the other.

"You cannot askIran to play on one level while you allow Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea to play on other levels."

Turki said a successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness, a "universal nuclear security umbrella" for the

countries in the area, and "a good military option" against any regional country which does not cooperate.

 He said Clinton had undermined efforts to move toward a regional nuclear-free zone, after the UN Security Council's five
 permanent members recently expressed support for the idea.

"Alas... Clinton then voided the issue of its value by stating that the conditions do not yet exist for establishing the zone,"

 he said.

 "Why, then, did she join the other members of the P5 in issuing their statement?"

 Turki said he hoped Obama "will find the way to correct his secretary of state's nullification of making our area free of
 weapons of mass destruction."

 Turki also warned of rising violence in Iraq after the pullout of US troops next year, warning both internal and external

 groups seek to carve up the country.

 "Imagine what will happen once internal strife and fighting escalates" following the US pullout, he said.

 Without a UN Security Council effort to protect Iraq's current borders, the consequence could be "regional conflict on a
 scale not seen since the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 17th and 18th centuries," he warned.

As we all are.

This is the basic message frame we are online working on right now:

•    This trip is about the Haitian people, and the United States' commitment -- indeed my personal commitment -- to
their future.

•    The United States is here to help for the long haul as Haiti works to recover from the great disaster of last year's

earthquake; to cope with challenges like the cholera outbreak; and to secure their vision of a more stable and
prosperous country.

•    We are also here with a simple message with respect to the elections: the voices of the people of Haiti must be

heard. The votes of the people of Haiti must be counted fairly. And the outcome of this process must reflect the true
will of the Haitian people. That is the only interest of the United States. We will stand in solidarity with all those

pursuing these goals, and we will stand against those who seek to undermine them.

•    So today I am meeting with Haiti's leaders to share these messages, and I am meeting with Haiti's citizens to pledge
our enduring commitment and to honor their independence, resiliency, and their dreams for Haiti's future.

Ask him if he has thoughts/edits.

 MEMO
 FROM: Sen. Jon Kyl, Sen. Bob Corker
 TO: Republican Members

 DATE: November 24, 2010
 RE: Progress in Defining Nuclear Modernization Requirements

         We appreciate your willingness to consider New START in the context of modernization of our

 nuclear complex and the weapons it supports.

         In advance of having an opportunity to discuss the issue more fully next week in Washington,
 we want to summarize the status of our discussions with the administration.

 Summary

         Throughout the Obama administration's pursuit of a New START treaty, we have been clear,
 as has Secretary Gates,' that we could not support reductions in U.S. nuclear forces unless there is
 adequate attention to modernizing those forces and the infrastructure that supports them. The
 Administration's recent update of the 1251 plan, originally submitted in May in accordance with

 Section 1251 of the FY2010 NDAA, is an acknowledgment that more resources are needed to
 accomplish the objectives set forth in the Nuclear Posture Review for the modernization of the U.S.
 nuclear deterrent. This memo discusses our concerns with the original 1251 plan, changes made and

 our assessment of those changes and remaining issues.

 Background – the Decline of the Nuclear Weapon Stockpile and Infrastructure

         Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. nuclear weapons infrastructure (including laboratories,
 production facilities and supporting capabilities) has been allowed to deteriorate. The weapons have

 remained safe, secure and reliable, but they and their caretakers have been in a state of limbo—only
 when critical problems have arisen has action been taken. The production facilities are Cold War
 relics, safety and security costs have grown exponentially, and critical skills have been jeopardized

 through layoffs, hiring freezes, and the retirement of skilled scientists and technicians who earlier were
 able to fullyexercise the full set of nuclear weapons-related skills. In FY2010, the Obama
 administration invested only $6.4 billion in the National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons
 Activities funding line, a 20% loss in purchasing power from FY2005 alone.    2It is no longer possible to

 continue deferring maintenance of either the facilities or the weapons. As a result, the 2010 Nuclear
 Posture Review set forth a broad range of modernization and sustainment requirements that would be
 impossible without additional budget support.

          A detailed explanation of these concepts is located in the appendix to this memo; but to help

 understand the current situation, imagine an automotive expert working in a garage built in 1942. The
 roof leaks and his tools are becoming outdated. Moreover, he has responsibility for a fleet of eight

  International Peace, October 28, 2008. ("To be blunt, there is absolutely no way we can maintain a credible deterrent and
 reduce the number of weapons in our stockpile without either resorting to testing our stockpile or pursuing a modernization

 racing Ferraris, which have been sitting in storage for about 30 years. The last time any engine was

 turned on was 1992, but this "steward" is responsible for assuring that, at any given moment, each of
 the eight finely-tuned cars will respond to the key turn. To do this, he is allowed to assess components
 of the cars for aging—leaks, cracks, rust, etc. (though he isn't able to look at the components often

 enough and in sufficient detail because of his maintenance budget).

         Even on a shoe-string budget, he is beginning to see signs of age throughout the fleet, and
 realizes that each and every car will require a complete overhaul (a "life extension" program). To be
 successful, he needs a new garage, updated tools, and skilled assistants (because truthfully, the expert

 will be retiring long before the overhauls are complete, assuming his pension fund is still solvent). He
 will have to replace some of the parts (especially the electronics – some of his fleet of Ferraris still
 have vacuum tubes), because they just aren't available anymore; but some parts will have to be reused,
 or manufactured to be as close to the original as possible. Some of the original parts contained

 materials that are now illegal for safety or environmental reasons. To add to the problem, the owner is
 asking for air bags, anti-lock brakes and anti-theft technology. Each overhaul will take about a decade,
 from planning through execution and without a new garage, he will be unable to finish the overhauls
 on time. And at the end of the day, the mechanic is fairly certain that he will not be allowed to turn

 the ignition to check his work.

         This is the state of our nuclear deterrent today, except, we're dealing not with cars, but with the
 most sophisticated and dangerous weapons ever devised by man.

 Section 1251 Plan and FY2011 Budget – A Response to the Nuclear Posture Review

         The initial section 1251 report showed a ten-year budget plan for Weapons Activities totaling
 $80 billion. But most of that $80 billion is not directed at modernization activities called for in the
 NPR—it is mostly consumed in "keeping the lights on" at the laboratories and plants, including safety,
 security, facility upkeep (which is difficult on very old facilities that would have been replaced long

 ago in the private sector), and routine warhead maintenance.

         Only about $10 billion of that ten year number was for new weapons activity, about half of it
 coming from DOD and half from "savings" assumed from low inflation projections. We doubt such
 savings can be realized and the DOD funding is not enough to cover everything that needs to be done.

 It provides for a small increase to stockpile surveillance for warhead evaluation, funding for the W76
 life extension program and the B61 and W78 life extension studies, and partial funding for badly-
 needed design, engineering and a modest investment for construction of new plutonium and uranium
 processing facilities—the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) nuclear facility

 and the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF).3These new facilities will replace Manhattan Project-era
 buildings that are a substantial maintenance burden and are becoming increasingly challenging to
 maintain in a safe and operable condition.

         Recognizing that more money was needed up front, the administration's FY2011 budget

 request of $7.0 billion for Weapons Activities improved the FY2010 budget by $624 million. The

 3The CMRR and UPF funding was based on estimated facility costs of $2 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, with a
 2022 completion date for both facilities.
                                                       2

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777999 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

 $624 million was included as a budget "anomaly" in the two month C.R. we passed before the October
 recess, but will have to be maintained in the longer-term C.R. or Omnibus we will pass in December.

         The initial 1251 plan left a lot of questions about how all the work articulated in the NPR

 would be funded. Numerous experts expressed concerns about obvious shortfalls in funding and about
 restrictions placed on designers that will constrain their ability to work through stockpile issues. The
 funding levels for CMRR and UPF were of significant concern, as was the funding for Life Extension

 Programs—especially to incorporate improved safety, security and reliability in these warheads. And
 of great concern to the directors of the national weapons laboratories, much of the promised budget
 increase for modernization was not pledged until FY16, by which point the Administration's

 commitment (if it is still in office) may have waned.4As a result, we requested an update to the 1251
 plan that would answer the questions we raised and that would show a stronger commitment to
 modernization.

 Updated 1251 Plan

         After reviewing our questions, and with further review of the requirements imposed by the
 NPR, the Administration agreed that updated budgets were required.5Thus, on November 17, 2010, an

 updated 1251 report was provided to the Senate, including an early FY12 budget projection with White
 House approval.6The 1251 update, and the briefing provided as part of the update, satisfied many, but
 not all, of the initial questions we had earlier expressed.

         The 1251 plan update increases the FY2012 budget request by an additional $600 million,
  increases the FY2012 five-year plan by $4.1 billion, and adds to the total FYI I ten-year plan between
 $5.4 and $6.2 billion. We are told that the new increases will not be taken from the DOD budget line.
  This update brings the ten-year plan (from FY11) to between $85.4 and $86.2 billion. *Again,

  approximately $70 billion of the original pledge of $80 billion was needed just to maintain current
  operations of the nuclear weapons complex, without covering the expense of the needed modernization
  of the stockpile or infrastructure. This update also includes revised cost estimates for CMRR and

  UPF; those estimates now range from $3.7 to $5.8 billion for CMRR and $4.2 to $6.5 billion for UPF.

          The new $4.1 billion for the five years of the FY2012 FYNSP is divided as follows:

          •   $340 million for design and engineering and modest construction activity for CMRR and
              UPF (see below for more detail);

          •   $1.7 billion (approximately) for other facility construction and maintenance requirements,
              including the High Explosive Pressing Facility at Pantex and test facilities at Sandia
              National Laboratories;

  Activities do not come to fruition until the second half of the ten year period." Dr. Michael R. Anastasio, Director Los

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777999 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

         •   $1.0 billion (approximately) for stockpile work, with added funding for life extension
             programs, stockpile surveillance and other design and research activities, though some of

             this funding ($255 million for the W76) is only needed because one life extension program
             will take longer due to the capacity bottleneck in the complex;

         •   $1.1 billion for contractor pension obligations spread through Weapons Activities accounts
             (which, while needed, does not support modernization).

 Remaining Concerns

         Despite this new increase, there remain a few substantial concerns about the adequacy of the
 proposed budget. For one, the Administration is attempting to address the enormous increases in the

 cost estimates for CMRR and LTPF by delaying the full operation of those facilities by one to two
 years. This would stretch the final completion of CMRR to 2023 and UPF to 2024, although the
 Administration states that some operational capability would be established (as required) in 2020. If
 extended, hundreds of millions of dollars would be needed annually to maintain Manhattan Project-era
 facilities at LANL &amp; Y-12.   Additional funding could be applied to accelerate the construction of

 these facilities to ensure on schedule completion and prevent wasted investments in maintaining
 and securing facilities that are being replaced anyway.

         Furthermore, the Administration is ignoring the benefits of ensuring funding commitments for

 these facilities early in the budget process. Responsible advance funding mechanisms exist, such as a
 FY12 request for three-year rolling funding (recommended by some NNSA budget specialists7), or
 alternatively, an Administration commitment to seek advanced funding in FY13 following the
 completion of the 90% design cost estimate.    Further Administration effort to advance funding is

 the best path to successful completion of these facilities.

         Given the need to live with our currently aging stockpile until an adequate production
 capability is established (after 2020), accurate assessment of the state of the current stockpile is

 paramount. The 1251 plan update shows a doubling of surveillance funding from FY09 to FY11—
 which is commendable—but it is our understanding that the NNSA is reviewing an updated
 surveillance plan that could lead to greater budget requirements. NNSA should affirm that this
 review been completed and the budget request will reflect updated requirements.

         Finally, the 1251 update made clear that NNSA will not restore a production capability
 adequate to maintain our current stockpile levels (declassified as 5,113 weapons total), and instead
 allow up to 1,500 warheads to be retired or held with no maintenance unless funding increases are
 sought and obtained. Failing to maintain hedge weapons will increase the risk that the U.S. cannot

 respond to a problem in our aging stockpile.  The Administration should not engage in further cuts
 to our deployed or non-deployed stockpile without first determining if such cuts are in our
 national security interest and then obtaining corresponding reductions in other nations' nuclear
 weapons stockpiles, such as Russia's large stockpile of weapons not limited by New START (e.g.,

 its tactical nuclear weapons).

 Modernization of U.S. strategic delivery systems

        The 1251 update deals not only with our nuclear weapons, bu the delivery systems that are part
 of our TRIAD. The update indicates somewhat clearer intent by the Administration to pursue a
 follow-on heavy bomber (though not specifically nuclear) and air-launched cruise missile (ALCM),
 though development costs beyond FY 2015 are yet to be determined. While the update notes that

 estimated costs for a follow-on bomber for FY 2011 through FY 2015 are $1.7 billion, there are still no
 costs or funding commitments beyond FY 2015. It is the same for the ALCM: $800 million is
 programmed over the FYDP, but no cost estimates are included beyond FY 2015.      We should have a
 better idea of these estimated costs over the full ten-years of the 1251 plan, and know whether

 the, Administration intends to make this new heavy bomber and ALCM nuclear capable.

        Decision-making for an ICBM follow-on is unlikely before FY 2015, at the completion of an
 ongoing analysis of alternatives. The update notes: "While a decision on an ICBM follow-on is not

 needed for several years, preparatory analysis is needed and is in fact now underway. This work will
 consider a range of deployment options, with the objective of defining a cost-effective approach for an
 ICBM follow-on that supports continued reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons    while promoting stable
 deterrence." (emphasis added) We think it important to understand what the Administration intends
 when it suggests that a decision regarding a follow-on ICBM must be guided, in part, by whether it

 "supports continued reductions"  in U.S. nuclear weapons — especially since we seriously doubt it's in
 our interests to pursue reductions beyond the New START treaty. One logical inference from this
 criterion is that a follow-on ICBM is no longer needed because the U.S. ismoving  to drastically lower
 numbers of nuclear weapons.   We continue to press for a letter from the DOD confirming its

 commitment to follow-on nuclear-capable delivery systems.

 Conclusion

        Until these issues are resolved, it will be difficult to adequately assess the updated 1251 plan,
 despite the welcome increases in proposed spending. And as has always been clear, assurances from
 the appropriate authorizers and appropriators must be obtained to ensure that the enacted budget
 reflects the President's request.

                                                      APPENDIX

             Briefly, some of the stockpile programs most affected by the lack of Administration support for

     modernization include:

•   Replacing Manhattan Project-era Facilities: Since the closure of the Rocky Flat Plant in 1989, the
    U.S. has had only a limited capability to produce the core component of our stockpile weapons: the

    plutonium pit. To establish a pit production capability, a 60 year-old research laboratory must be
    replaced by the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) nuclear facility at Los
    Alamos. Likewise, producing uranium components at the 70 year-old facility at Y-12 in Oak Ridge is

    an increasing risk that requires construction of a new Uranium Processing Facility (UPF). Completion
    of these new facilities will be essential in meeting life extension program requirements starting in 2020.

•   Production Capacity: As Secretary Gates stated, "Currently, the United States is the only declared

    nuclear power that is neither modernizing its nuclear arsenal nor has the capability to produce a new
    nuclear warhead."8The United States requires a nuclear weapon production capability with sufficient
    capacity to satisfy the life extension requirement of our aging weapons, as well as to provide a "hedge"
    against future technical or political problems. Currently, we are limited to producing a handful of

    plutonium pits a year for one weapon, but are unprepared to produce most of the remaining pieces of
    that weapon.9  Modernization of the NNSA laboratories and plants is required to correct this issue, with
    the stated goal of establishing a "capability-based"   10 production capacity. Without this capacity, there

    can be no stockpile reductions. In fact, General Chilton argues the stockpile might have to be
    increased: "1 would say because of the lack of a production capacity there's a fear that you might need
    to increase your deployed numbers because of the changing and uncertain strategic environment in the

    future."

•   Life Extension Programs: Under current policy, the laboratories and plants are constrained to
    extending the life of existing warheads to keep them in the stockpile for much longer than originally

    expected. Thus, as the weapons age and concerns are observed, the laboratories and plants determine
    how best to repair the weapons. Aging components are replaced, remanufactured or inspected for reuse
    in the stockpile. In performing life extension for the W87 and the ongoing W76, our experts have
    discovered that it is very difficult to reconstitute processes  and capabilities that have been allowed to

    atrophy. Currently, the W76 warhead is in LEP production, the B61 LEP study is underway and the

     capacity for a timely response." Statement of Thomas P. D'Agostino, Administrator, National Nuclear Security

    NPR called for an FY2011 start to a W78/W88 LEP study that will research if the two warheads can be
    life-extended simultaneously.

•   Surveillance:  The average age of our current nuclear weapons is approaching 30 years. To ensure that
    each warhead remains reliable, each year approximately 11 warheads per type should be returned from
    the military for dismantlement and evaluation. Components are inspected and tested to ensure reliable
    operation. This program aids in the annual assessment of the stockpile performed by the laboratories

    and is the lead mechanism for identifying potential stockpile issues. Due to inadequate funding,
    surveillance requirements have not been met for many years, raising concerns about confidence in the
    stockpile.

•   Deferring Maintenance, Creating Chokepoints:       In addition to the CMRR and UPF construction
    projects to replace aging facilities, a significant number of buildings in our laboratories and plants have

    been accumulating a backlog of maintenance. This deferred maintenance creates a substantial number
    of facilities that could (and occasionally do) become a choke point in the progress of a life extension
    program. Maintenance can only be deferred for so long, until, eventually, something breaks; and when
    it does break, it is usually much more expensive to replace than routine maintenance would have cost.

    Reducing deferred maintenance is a demonstration that we are moving from a nuclear weapons
    complex in decline, to a revitalized and robust capability.

•   Critical Skills: Perhaps the most significant attribute of a strong deterrent is the scientific and
    technical capability that is present in our laboratories and military complex. Maintaining those skills,
    especially as most nuclear-test experienced weapon designers are past retirement age, is a growing

    challenge within the NNSA laboratories and plants.

•   Hedging:   Without a robust production capability, the U.S. maintains a large non-deployed stockpile as
    a technical hedge against stockpile concerns and a political hedge that allows rapid upload should
    another nation become increasingly adversarial. With the technical hedge, if one weapon type were
    discovered to have an urgent issue requiring replacement, alternate components in the force structure

    theoretically could be used to compensate for that loss of capability. For example, W78 warheads on
    Minuteman III might be replaced by W87 warheads maintained in storage, and vice-versa.

•   Delivery Systems: Nuclear weapon delivery systems require replacement within the next thirty years.
    These systems include:

        o  The B-52H bomber, first deployed in 1961 and scheduled to be sustained through 2035;

        o
           The B-2 penetrating bomber, deployed in 1993 is currently being updated for long-term
           sustainment;

        o  The Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), deployed in 1981 and scheduled to be sustained
           through 2030;

        o  The Minuteman III ICBM, deployed in 1970, undergoing life extension and scheduled for
           replacement by 2030;

        o
           And the ballistic missile submarines and missiles. Ohio-class SSBNs were first deployed in
           1981 and commence retirement in 2027. The Trident H Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile
           (SLBM), deployed in 1990, will be sustained through at least 2042, following a life extension.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

The Cancun Agreements

Over the last year, the United States has worked with our international partners to build on the progress achieved at the
climate change conference in Copenhagen. We have pressed for substantive steps that would advance the vision of the

Copenhagen Accord. This month we joined the nations of the world in Cancun for a new round of talks aimed at
mobilizing common action to meet the shared global challenge of climate change.

Today I am pleased to announce that we secured the Cancun Agreements, a set of balanced international decisions

under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) which represent meaningful progress in
our global response to climate change.

These agreements advance each of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord: They anchor the Accord's mitigation

pledges; build on a system of transparency with substantial detail and content of International Consultations and
Analysis which will provide confidence that a country's pledges are being carried out; launch a new Green Climate Fund;

create a framework to reduce deforestation in developing countries; establish a technology mechanism; and Setup a
framework and committee to will promote international cooperation and action on adaptation.

The Cancun Agreements represent a balanced and significant step forward. In the days and months ahead, the United

States will work with our friends and partners to keep the world focused on this urgent challenge and to continue
building on this progress.

           The Perils of Ignoring History: Big Tobacco

           Played Dirty and Millions Died. How

           Similar Is Big Food?

           K E L L Y D . B R O W N E L L a n d K E N N E T H E . W A R N E R

           Yale University; University of Michigan

           Context: In 1954 the tobacco industry paid to publish the "Frank Statement to
           Cigarette Smokers" in hundreds of U.S. newspapers. It stated that the public's

           health was the industry's concern above all others and promised a variety of
           good-faith changes. What followed were decades of deceit and actions that cost
           millions of lives. In the hope that the food history will be written differently,

           this article both highlights important lessons that can be learned from the
           tobacco experience and recommends actions for the food industry.

           Methods: A review and analysis of empirical and historical evidence pertaining
           to tobacco and food industry practices, messages, and strategies to influence

           public opinion, legislation and regulation, litigation, and the conduct of science.

           Findings: The tobacco industry had a playbook, a script, that emphasized
           personal responsibility, paying scientists who delivered research that instilled

           doubt, criticizing the "junk" science that found harms associated with smoking,
           making self-regulatory pledges, lobbying with massive resources to stifle gov-
           ernment action, introducing "safer" products, and simultaneously manipulating

           and denying both the addictive nature of their products and their marketing to
           children. The script of the food industry is both similar to and different from
           the tobacco industry script.

           Conclusions: Food is obviously different from tobacco, and the food industry

           differs from tobacco companies in important ways, but there also are significant
           similarities in the actions that these industries have taken in response to concern
           that their products cause harm. Because obesity is now a major global problem,

           the world cannot afford a repeat of the tobacco history, in which industry talks

          about the moral high ground but does not occupy it.
           Keywords:  Food, obesity, tobacco, industry, ethics, politics, public policy.

              N DECEM BER 1953, THE CEOs OF THE M AJOR TOBACCO
              companies met secretly in New York City. Their purpose was to

          1   counter the damage from studies linking smoking to lung cancer. A
          year earlieReader'sDigest---thethe public's leading source medical
          information—had printed an article entitled "Cancer by the Carton"

          (Norr 1952). After it appeared, cigarette sales plummeted for two years,
           the first such decline of the century except during the Great Depression.
             Working closely with John Hal, the founder of the public relations

          giant Hill &amp; Knowlton, the industry created "A Frank Statement to
          Cigarette Smokers" and paid to have it published in 448 newspapers
          on January 4, 1954. To give the industry a human face, the statement
           included the signatures of the nation's top tobacco executives and as-

          sured Americans that "we accept an interest in people's health as a basic
           responsibility, paramount to every other consideration in our business."
           Furthermore, they promised that "we always have and always will coop-
           erate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public's health"

           (Tobacco Industry Research Committee 1954).
             The "Frank Statement" was a charade, the first step in a concerted,
           half-century-long campaign to mislead Americans about the catastrophic

           effects of smoking and to avoid public policy that might damage sales.
           Unearthed later, industry documents showed the repeated duplicity of
           its executives. Everything was at stake. The industry wanted desperately
           to prevent, or at least delay, shifts in public opinion that would permit

           a barrage of legislative, regulatory, and legal actions that would erode
           sales and profits.
             Today another industry is under attack for marketing products per-
           ceived by some to damage health, and it also faces legislative, regulatory,

           and legal threats that could fundamentally alter how it does business.
           Schools are banning soft drinks and snack foods; legislation requiring
           calorie labels on restaurant menus has been passed at state and local
           levels and is being considered nationally; restrictions in food marketing

           practices have been proposed around the world; and even radical mea-
           sures such as taxing snack foods are part of the national debate. Such

           The Perils of Ignoring History	                                   261

           actions invite comparison of the food and tobacco industries, exempli-

           fied by a Fortunemagazine cover story in 2003 entitled "Is Fat the Next
           Tobacco?" The cover depicted a French fry lying in an ash tray as if it

           were a cigarette. The article did what is now common—debate the par-
           allels between tobacco and food in the context of culpability for health
           damage and ask whether Big Food should be sued for the same reasons

           that Big Tobacco was.
              There are, of course, differences between food and tobacco as sub-
           stances. The most obvious is that humans must eat to maintain health

           and life, whereas the unnecessary activity of smoking is, in the words
           of former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Joseph Califano,

           "slow-motion suicide." Moreover, selling tobacco to children is illegal,
           but there currently are no restrictions on food sales. Tobacco has a well-
           chronicled addictive process, whereas research on food and addiction is

           just now maturing. And although the fight against tobacco coalesced
           around a single product made by a few companies, food and its industries

           are far more complex.
              The more important issue is whether tobacco history is instructive
           in addressing the problems created by unhealthy diets. A half cen-

           tury of tobacco industry deception has had tragic consequences: Since
           the "Frank Statement," approximately 16 million Americans have died

           from smoking, and millions more have suffered from debilitating dis-
           eases ranging from emphysema to heart disease. Had the industry come
           clean in 1954—matching deeds with promises—many of these deaths

           would almost certainly have been prevented. No one knows how many.
           Perhaps 3 million. Maybe 5 million. Maybe 7 million—just in the
            United States. An honest approach by industry might have saved more

           lives than any public health measure taken during the past fifty years.
           Furthermore, if industry had made good faith efforts globally, rather than
           exploit and addict the developing world, the benefits could have been

           stunning.
              Food, physical inactivity, and obesity may be in the same league.

           An astonishing two-thirds of the U.S. adult population is overweight
           or obese (Ogden er al. 2007). As with smoking, social justice issues are
           prominent, given that obesity rates are highest in the poorest segments of

            the population (Kurnanyika 2006). But weight issues are hardly unique
            to the United States. The World Health Organization has declared
           obesity a global epidemic, now surpassing hunger as the chief nutrition

           problem, even in some developing countries (WHO 2004).

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775992 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

           262

              Obesity rates are especially troubling in children, rising at three
           times the rate of increase in adults (Ogden, Carroll, and Flegal 2008).
           Indeed, the term  adult onset diabetess now been scrapped and replaced

           with  Type 2 diabetesbecause children as young as eight are developing
           the disease. Canadian researchers conducted a fifteen-year follow-up of
           children diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and found an alarming rate in

           young adults of blindness, amputation, kidney failure requiring dialysis,
           pregnancy loss, and death (Dean and Flett 2002). Health experts now

           are asking whether America's children will be the first in the nation's
           history to live shorter lives than their parents (Olshansky et al. 2005).
              Such statistics worry people, leading the press, parent groups, school

           officials, nutrition experts, health care providers, and government leaders
            to conclude that something must be done. Caught in the crosshairs,

            the food industry is reacting, sometimes with heavy ammunition. As
           an example, in response to menu-labeling     .initiatives, the restaurant
            industry has sued New York City, used its political might to weaken

            legislation in California, and successfully encouraged federal legislators
            to introduce weak national legislation that would preempt states and

            cities from acting more aggressively.
              There are striking similarities, and some differences, in the way the
            food and tobacco industries have responded to public mistrust, damning

            scientific evidence, and calls for legal and legislative actions. As an
            important example of the similarities, food companies have issued their
            own versions of frank statements, stating their concern with the public's

            well-being and pledging to make changes to benefit public health. In
            this article we discuss what can be learned from tobacco and propose
            what might be done to avoid the repetition of a deadly history.

            A  Crossroads for Food

            The food industry is on the defensive, hit hard by nutrition groups and

            public health professionals, the press, parent groups, child advocacy or-
            ganizations, and state and national legislators sponsoring bills that could
            have a powerful impact on business. Popular books like  Fast Food Nation

            (Schlosser 2001) and movies like Supersize Me have sensitized the public
            to industry practices. In turn, the industry has had to react to claims that
            it seduces children into a lifestyle of unhealthy eating, infiltrates schools,

            buys loyalty from scientists, and pressures administration officials into

           accepting weak and ineffective nutrition policies (Brownell and Horgen
           2004; Nestle 2002).

              To the extent that these charges are fair, the analogy with the tobacco
           experience is inescapable. Seducing children? There is no better example

           than Joe Camel. Buying the loyalty of scientists? It happened time
           and again with tobacco. Using pressure to stall or prevent needed policy
           change? Few industries have been more effective than tobacco (Advocacy

           Institute 1998).
              A first step is to understand the industry players. Unlike tobacco,

           with one major product and a handful of companies producing it, food
           involves an immense array of products made by thousands of companies
           worldwide. The industry is diverse and fragmented in some ways, count-

           ing as its players a local baker making bread for a few stores; a family
           running a convenience store; an organic farmer; mega companies like

           Kraft, McDonalds, and Coca-Cola; and even Girl Scouts selling cookies.
           The same company making fried foods laden with saturated fat might
           also sell whole-grain cereal.

              In other ways, the industry is organized and politically powerful. It
           consists of massive agribusiness companies like Cargill, Archer Daniels
           Midland, Bunge, and Monsanto; food sellers as large as Kraft (so big

           as to own Nabisco) and Pepsi-Co (owner of Frito Lay); and restaurant
           companies as large as McDonald's and Yum! Brands (owner of Pizza

           Hut, Taco Bell, KFC, and more). These are represented by lobbyists,
           lawyers, and trade organizations that in turn represent a type of food (e.g.,
           Snack Food Association, American Beverage Association), a segment of

           the industry (e.g., National Restaurant Association), a constituent of
           food (e.g., Sugar Association, Corn Refiners Association), or the entire
           industry (e.g., Grocery Manufacturers of America).

              Common to all these players is an arresting logic: to successfully
           address the obesity epidemic, the nation must consume fewer calories,

           which means eating less food. Marion Nestle (2002) estimates that the
           number of daily calories created for the American food supply rose from
           3,300 per person in 1970 to 3,800 in the late 1990s, far in excess of what

           the average person needs to maintain a healthy weight. If consumers'
           demand for food were to reflect what they needed to maintain a healthy

           weight, the market would contract. A shrinking market for all those
           calories would mean less money—a lot less.
              Of course there will always be a need for food—people cannot stop eat-

           ing. But thetypesandamounts  of food people eat must change dramatically

Cheryl:

Below are the key elements of a statement which we would like to see the President send to the upcoming conference
on Ocean Law Policy May 20-21 The Law of the Sea Treaty ratification has been a serious policy interest of this

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775062 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

administration. I realize there are other priorities but the the draft takes that into account. Anything that the Secretary
might be able to do to get this statement issued by the President and sent to the Conference would be much
appreciated. If that looks like too much heavy lifting and I know that is a rare commodity to be used judiciously, anything

she might send herself along these lines would convey a clear and valuable signal and be most appreciated at home and
abroad.(l have attached a conference agenda for your information). Tom Pickering

"I congratulate the Commission on Ocean Law Policy in your meeting to review the record and support the ratification
by the United States of the Law of the Sea Treaty. I am pleased to join with every American President since the treaty
was first submitted to the Senate in 1994, whether Democratic or Republican, all of whom have supported United

States' adherence since the Convention. It is an important goal of this administration to secure Senate advice and
consent to the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea [this year] [as soon as possible]. The convention has the support

of every living Chief of Naval Operations and Commandant of the US Coast Guard, the endorsement of every living
former Secretary of State since the Reagan Administration, the leading business organizations and industry associations
and hundreds of other security experts, practitioners and scholars. By adopting this Convention, America will join 159

other nations plus the European Union in supporting the rule of law in the world's oceans. The Convention strengthens
our security, secures our sovereignty and promotes the sustainable development of our ocean resources Adoption will
facilitate access to offshore resources, enhance naval and air mobility, strengthen homeland security, and restore United

States leadership in ocean affairs."

Arm Syria's Rebels

By ROGER COHEN
             Here are some home truths about Syria. It's going to get worse before it gets better. Nobody can put this genie back in a
LONDON —
bottle. This is the mother of all proxy fights. The remorseless Assad regime is finished, when it dies being the only question.

Nations get to freedom from tyranny by different routes. When Communism fell, some glided from the Soviet empire into the West as

others agonized. Yugoslavia — a beautiful idea that never worked — is one of several nations being invoked as possible exemplars of

Syria's bloody fate; others include Lebanon and Iraq.

The ingredients are familiar: Syria is a multiethnic state ruled with an iron fist by one minority — the quasi-Shiite Alawites — and

 including Christian, Druze and other minorities that between them compose about a quarter of the population. The majority is Sunni.

 When the iron fist comes off in countries like this, liberty is more readily seen as getting free of each other than uniting in the give-and-

 take of a new liberal order.

 So it has proved for a year now in the Syria of Bashar al-Assad who, taking a leaf from his father's book, has attempted to suppress
 through mass slaughter the quest of a broad uprising to be free of the family stranglehold. Assad is a doctor by training! No doctor ever

 trampled so brazenly on the Hippocratic Oath.

 The Assads are a mafia, a minority (the family) within a minority (the Alawites) within a minority (the Mukhabarat secret police). They

 co-opted others — notably the Sunni merchant class — through imposed stability, but in essence, like every tyrant dislodged in the Arab

 Spring, they have ruled a nation as if it was their personal fiefdom, a plaything to be passed from father to son for the benefit of cousins

 and cronies.

 Well, that's over. Aleppo is the not the new Marrakesh after all. Those lovely tourism posters on London buses have been packed away.

 Arabs have had it with their Godfathers.

 I said it's going to get worse before it gets better. The Syrian compact is broken; a new compact under the Assads is inconceivable.

 Wider interests are in play. Iranian Shiite theocracy, increasingly isolated, is defending the regime against a Free Syrian Army funded in
 part by Saudi Sunni theocracy: that's the proxy war.

 Vladimir Putin, fearful of Russian Springs in his own neighborhood, has with signature cynicism opted to defend an old ally against U.S.

  demands that Assad go, an objective not pursued with any coherence until now by the Obama administration. Israel knows Assad, who

  helps arm Hezbollah but is a predictable and largely passive enemy. It does not know what may lie beyond a security state whose habits

  it can predict.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791732 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

In short, Syria is dangerous. But that not a reason for passivity or incoherence. As the Bosnian war showed, the basis for any settlement

must be a rough equality of forces. So I say step up the efforts, already quietly ongoing, to get weapons to the Free Syrian Army. Train

those forces, just as the rebels were trained in Libya. Payback time has come around: The United States warned Assad about allowing Al

Qaeda fighters to transit Syria to Iraq. Now materiel and special forces with the ability to train a ragtag army can transit Iraq — and
other neighboring states — into Syria. This should be a joint effort of Western and Arab states.

At the same time, mount a big U.N.-coordinated humanitarian effort centered on enclaves for refugees in Turkey, Jordan and

elsewhere, establishing, where possible, safe corridors to these havens.

Push hard to bring Russia and China around: They will not defend Assad beyond the point where that defense looks like a liability for

other bigger interests in the United States, the Gulf and Europe.

I hear the outcry already: Arming Assad's opponents will only exacerbate the fears of Syria's minorities and unite them, ensure greater

bloodshed, and undermine diplomatic efforts now being led by Kofi Annan, a gifted and astute peacemaker. It risks turning a proxy war

into a proxy conflagration.

There is no policy for Syria at this stage that does not involve significant risk. But the only cease-fire I can see that will not amount to an

ephemeral piece of paper is one based on a rough balance of forces. For that, the Free Syrian Army must be armed.

In the end, this course will support, not undermine, Annan's diplomacy and perhaps open the way for the sort of transition outlined by

the Arab League. In return, the divided Syrian opposition must provide a firm commitment to respect the rights of minorities. The
treatment of minorities — like that of women — is one of the many pivotal tests of the Arab Spring.

If Assad falls, Iran is critically weakened. Tehran's established conduit to Hezbollah disappears. Choosing between engineering the

downfall of Assad and bombing Iran's nuclear facilities is really a no-brainer: The former is smart and doable, the latter is folly. Assad's

wife has been buying property in London: Make her use it and make the Syrian people free.

"Subversive" isn't the preferred adjective for our work, but this article in upcoming Foreign Policy Magazine is
worth reading

Can the State Department's ambitious new plan to subvert autocratic regimes online actually succeed?

Last year, when Internet users in 12 authoritarian states tried to navigate to the social networking sites we take

for granted in the West, they encountered the usual government firewall blocking their access. But there was a

twist. Many of them also saw an advertisement alerting them to the fact they could download free tools to

circumvent this censorship. Almost half a million users did just that.

It wasn't the work of the hacking group Anonymous or a tech-savvy democracy activist; instead, the

organization funding the campaign was none other than the U.S. Department of State. And it was being rolled

out in a string of countries, like Bahrain, Egypt, and Vietnam, that are usually regarded as U.S. partners.

This was not an isolated incident. The rapid growth of online activity has opened up a whole new world of

possibilities for subtly undermining repressive regimes -- without boots on the ground and, so far, with only a

reasonably modest financial commitment. And the State Department has dived head first into this new frontier.

This online activism is not as narrowly targeted as subversive measures from years past, such as Western radio

broadcasts beamed into countries under repressive rule. Whereas these broadcasts only offered the opportunity

to passively receive another government's perspective on the world, a free Internet allows people everywhere to

 read whatever they want and express their views without fear of harassment ... theoretically.

 U.S. policymakers have put great stock in the transformative power of Internet freedom. As Secretary of State

 Hillary Clinton said, these tools will be used "to advance democracy and human rights, to fight climate change

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05790022 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

and epidemics, to build global support for President Obama's goal of a world without nuclear weapons, [and] to
encourage sustainable economic development that lifts the people at the bottom up."

This new tech-savvy approach to democracy promotion has been taken up by the U.S. government with

characteristic American zeal. Alec Ross, Clinton's senior advisor for innovation, framed the great conflict of the

21st century as between open and closed systems. The United States, he said, stood "for openness, with an open

Internet at its core." Congress has also lent its support, allocating the State Department and USAID a total of
$76 million from 2008 to 2011 for Internet freedom activities.

Not everyone, however, is convinced. Evgeny Morozov offers one blistering critique: In his book,    TheNet

Delusion,he points to the overwhelming costs of truly freeing the web, and the risks to activists who put too
much faith in circumvention tools that can never be made failsafe. Moreover, he argues that the Western focus

on freeing the Internet could have the perverse effect of driving even more restrictive policies from authoritarian

regimes.

Before settling on a position though, consider what the State Department is actually doing. The department's

Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL) is at the vanguard of this effort. Funding for DRL's

more subversive work was originally a Republican initiative, with strong backing from Falun Gong-linked

groups like the Global Internet Freedom Consortium. Not surprisingly, its initial focus was on China. It has
since been substantially expanded to other authoritarian regimes, particularly in the wake of the Arab Spring

and the subsequent attempts by governments in the region to both squelch and monitor Internet activism.

As a happy example of bipartisan consensus in Washington, the State Department has managed to secure a
steady stream of congressional funding. About half of these funds have been spent on developing technologies

to help activists circumvent direct government Internet censorship, and the other half on protecting websites and

blogs under attack. Most of DRL's work is outsourced to non-governmental organizations that prefer to keep
their funding on the down-low, due to the sensitive nature of their work. However, there are several projects

that have been made public.

The so-called  "Internet in a suitcase,"which was developed by the New America Foundation'sOpen

Technology Initiative,   is one prominent example. It is a type of mesh network that aims to allow activists to

continue communicating -- ideally anonymously -- even when a government tries to shut down the Internet, as
happened in several Arab Spring countries during the recent uprisings.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05790022 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

Another interesting project is a "panic button" called InTheClear,   which is in early Beta release. This mobile
application aims to allow individuals to instantly and comprehensively erase the contents of their phone, as well

as send out pre-written text messages to trusted contacts. That's a handy tool for an activist suddenly arrested by

security forces, or a journalist with confidential information recorded on his or her phone.

These programs are explicitly aimed at undermining other governments' censorship efforts, raising a series of

complex legal and diplomatic questions. However, the State Department has pushed full-steam ahead, focusing

on the loftier justifications for its actions. "Some countries have erected electronic barriers that prevent their

people from accessing portions of the world's networks," Clinton said in a January 2010 speech on Internet

freedom. "These actions contravene the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which tells us that all people
have the right, 'to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of

frontiers.'"

Iran, in particular, is a hot spot for subversive diplomacy at the State Department. Given the long history of

animosity between the two countries, the subversion is fairly blatant. When the State Department opened its
new  "Virtual Embassy Tehran" --      which was aimed at "bringing information and alternative viewpoints to the

Iranian people" according to State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland -- in December 2011, it was

blocked from view in Iran almost immediately. The State Department, when asked about this obstacle,      said  it

believed Iranians would still be able to access the website through other means, presumably using the tools
promoted by the State's circumvention campaign.

The Iran desk at the State Department also has two full-time bloggers working in Farsi who manage its three

main Farsi social media sites (Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter) that try to push critical messages of the regime
to Iranians online, like President Barack Obama's  recent statement   upon the Iranian holiday of Nowruz. These

and other more traditional democracy promotion efforts were the bread and butter of the Iran desk's engagement

activities until 2010, when its direction was significantly altered by a $10 million congressional earmark that
had to be spent on Internet freedom in Iran. In addition to the old approaches, it is now involved in three types

of activities: circumvention tool development; secure communications and platforms (for example, hosting

websites that are victims of Denial of Service attacks); and digital safety training for Iranian activists. In other

words, it's moving away from simple messaging to efforts to directly empower Iranian activists.

Subversive diplomacy is also not only aimed at undermining authoritarian regimes. State's Digital Outreach

Team has been targeting individuals and organizations online since 2006. What began as an effort to promote

soft messages about the United States among the Arabic blogosphere soon morphed into a much more tightly
 focused outfit dedicated to countering the rhetoric spewed by extremists online

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05790022 Date: 10/30/2015</span>

This is a small shop compared to the sprawling U.S. government agencies that work to gather intelligence
online. The team of 11 bloggers and one manager -- who openly acknowledge they are employed by the State

Department -- work in Arabic, Urdu, and Somali as a sort of counter propaganda unit, posting in comment

threads on sites like Al Jazeera and the BBC, and disproving conspiracy theories. For example, they have shot

down rumors circulating in Pakistan that Vice President Dick Cheney had ordered the assassination of Benazir
Bhutto. They also work to highlight the most negative and hypocritical sides of extremists -- such as Taliban

bomb attacks on girls' schools, and reports that the Yemeni-American terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki had solicited

prostitutes. It has also been involved in the production of videos such as this one, which ridicules Osama bin

Laden for being nowhere to be found during the Arab Spring.

Reviews on its effectiveness have so far been mixed. A Stanford University study analyzing its work concluded

that "the evidence points to a lack of impact" for the Digital Outreach Team's work. However, the study also

noted that the program's intended audience "is among the lurkers on blogs and Websites, who leave no evidence
of their reactions," hampering attempts to accurately gauge the initiative's influence.

While the State Department will certainly tweak its efforts at subversive diplomacy for maximum effect, the

epic dimensions that officials have used to frame this agenda suggest that it will be more than a fleeting
diplomatic objective. The struggle will be a long one: The State Department's $76 million is always going to be

a drop in the ocean compared to the mighty censorship resources of a country like China, and the cat and mouse

game between Internet freedom activists and repressive regimes will have mostly imperfect markers of success.

But despite the inevitable setbacks, the State Department has taken the first step to addressing the new realities

of activism through its subversive diplomacy program. Pro-democracy activists in authoritarian states are going

to continue their move online, and repressive regimes are going to use every available means to monitor, censor,

and harass them. Extremists will also continue to spout drivel online and do their best to bring in vulnerable
new recruits. But it's the American way to give those working for freedom -- whether on the ground or online --

a fighting chance.

Key Karzai Aide in Corruption Inquiry Is Linked to C.I.A.

August 25, 2010
By

DEXTER FILKINS and
MARK MAZZETTIKABUL, Afghanistan — The aide to President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan at the center of a politically

sensitive corruption investigation is being paid by the Central Intelligence Agency, according to Afghan and American
officials.

Mohammed Zia Salehi, the chief of administration for the National Security Council, appears to have been on the payroll

for many years, according to officials in Kabul and Washington. It is unclear exactly what Mr. Salehi does in exchange for
his money, whether providing information to the spy agency, advancing American views inside the presidential palace,

or both.

Mr. Salehi's relationship with the C.I.A. underscores deep contradictions at the heart of the Obama administration's
policy in Afghanistan, with American officials simultaneously demanding that Mr. Karzai root out the corruption that

pervades his government while sometimes subsidizing the very people suspected of perpetrating it.

Mr. Salehi was arrested in July and released after Mr. Karzai intervened. There has been no suggestion that Mr. Salehi's   .
ties to the C.I.A. played a role in his release; rather, officials say, it is the fear that Mr. Salehi knows about corrupt

dealings inside the Karzai administration.

The ties underscore doubts about how seriously the Obama administration intends to fight corruption here. The
anticorruption drive, though strongly backed by the United States, is still vigorously debated inside the administration.

Some argue it should be a centerpiece of American strategy, and others say that attacking corrupt officials who are
crucial to the war effort could destabilize the Karzai government.

The Obama administration is also racing to show progress in Afghanistan by December, when the White House will

evaluate its mission there. Some administration officials argue that any comprehensive campaign to fight corruption
inside Afghanistan is overly ambitious, with less than a year to go before the American military is set to begin

withdrawing troops.

"Fighting corruption is the very definition of mission creep," one Obama administration official said.

Others in the administration view public corruption as the single greatest threat to the Afghan government and the
American mission; it is the corrupt nature of the Karzai government, these officials say, that drives ordinary Afghans into

 the arms of the

Taliban. Other prominent Afghans who American officials have said were on the C.I.A.'s payroll include the president's
 half brother,

 Ahmed Wali Karzai, suspected by investigators of playing a role in Afghanistan's booming opium trade. Earlier this year,

 American officials did not press Mr. Karzai to remove his brother from his post as the chairman of the Kandahar
 provincial council. Mr. Karzai denies any monetary relationship with the C.I.A. and any links to the drug trade.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771377 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

Mr. Salehi was arrested by the Afghan police after, investigators say, they wiretapped him soliciting a bribe — in the

form of a car for his son — in exchange for impeding an American-backed investigation into a company suspected of
shipping billions of dollars out of the country for Afghan officials, drug smugglers and insurgents.

Mr. Salehi was released seven hours later, after telephoning Mr. Karzai from his jail cell to demand help, officials said,

and after Mr. Karzai forcefully intervened on his behalf.

The president sent aides to get him and has since threatened to limit the power of the anticorruption unit that carried •
out the arrest. Mr. Salehi could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. A spokesman for President Karzai did not

respond to a list of questions sent to his office, including whether Mr. Karzai knew that Mr. Salehi was a C.I.A. informant.

A spokesman for the C.I.A. declined to comment on any relationship with Mr. Salehi.

"The C.I.A. works hard to advance the full range of U.S. policy objectives in Afghanistan," said Paul Gimigliano, a
spokesman for the agency. "Reckless allegations from anonymous sources don't change that reality in the slightest."

An American official said the practice of paying government officials was sensible, even if they turn out to be corrupt or

unsavory.

"If we decide as a country that we'll never deal with anyone in Afghanistan who might down the road — and certainly
not at our behest — put his hand in the till, we can all come home right now," the American official said. "If you want

intelligence in a war zone, you're not going to get it from

Mother Teresa or Mary Poppins."

Last week, Senator

John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, flew to Kabul in part to discuss the Salehi case with Mr. Karzai. In an interview
afterward, Mr. Kerry expressed concern about Mr. Salehi's ties to the American government. Mr. Kerry appeared to

allude to the C.I.A., though he did not mention it.

"We are going to have to examine that relationship," Mr. Kerry said. "We are going to have to look at that very
carefully."

Mr. Kerry said he pressed Mr. Karzai to allow the anticorruption unit pursuing Mr. Salehi and others to move forward

unhindered, and said he believed he had secured a commitment from him to do so.

"Corruption matters to us," a senior Obama administration official said. "The fact that Salehi may have been on our
payroll does not necessarily change any of the basic issues here."

Mr. Salehi is a political survivor, who, like many Afghans, navigated shifting alliances through 31 years of war. He is a

former interpreter for

Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ethnic Uzbek with perhaps the most ruthless reputation among all Afghan warlords.

 Mr. Dostum, a Karzai ally, was one of the C.I.A.'s leading allies on the ground in Afghanistan in the weeks after the Sept.
 11, 2001, attacks. The agency employed his militia to help rout the Taliban from northern Afghanistan.

Over the course of the nine-year-old war, the C.I.A. has enmeshed itself in the inner workings of Afghanistan's national

 security establishment. From 2002 until just last year, the C.I.A. paid the entire budget of Afghanistan's spy service, the
 National Directorate of Security.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771377 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

Mr. Salehi often acts as a courier of money to other Afghans, according to an Afghan politician who spoke on the
condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation.

Among the targets of the continuing Afghan anticorruption investigation is a secret fund of cash from which payments

were made to various individuals, officials here said.

Despite Mr. Salehi's status as a low-level functionary, the Afghan politician predicted that Mr. Karzai would never allow
his prosecution to go forward, whatever the pressure from the United States. Mr. Salehi knows too much about the

inner workings of the palace, he said.

"Karzai will protect him," the politician said, "because by going after him, you are opening the gates."

Mr. Salehi is a confidant of some of the most powerful people in the Afghan government, including Engineer Ibrahim,

who until recently was the deputy chief of the Afghan intelligence service. Earlier this year, Mr. Salehi accompanied Mr.
Ibrahim to Dubai to meet leaders of the Taliban to explore prospects for peace, according to a prominent Afghan with

knowledge of the meeting.

Mr. Salehi was arrested last month in the course of a sprawling investigation into New Ansari, a money transfer firm that
relies on couriers and other rudimentary means to move cash in and out of Afghanistan.

New Ansari was founded in the 1990s when the Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan. In the years since 2001, New Ansari

grew into one of the most important financial hubs in Afghanistan, transferring billions of dollars in cash for prominent
Afghans out of the country, most of it to Dubai.

New Ansari's offices were raided by Afghan agents, with American backing, in January. An American official familiar with

the investigation said New Ansari appeared to have been transferring money for wealthy Afghans of every sort,
including politicians, insurgents and drug traffickers.

"They were moving money for everybody," the American official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The flow of capital out of Afghanistan is so large that it makes up a substantial portion of Afghanistan's gross domestic
product. In an interview, a United Arab Emirates customs official said it received about $1 billion from Afghanistan in

2009. But the American official said the amount might be closer to $2.5 billion — about a quarter of Afghanistan's gross

domestic product.

Much of the New Ansari cash was carried by couriers flying from Kabul and Kandahar, usually to Dubai, where many

Afghan officials maintain second homes and live in splendorous wealth.

An American official familiar with the investigation said the examination of New Ansari's books was providing rich

insights into the culture of Afghan corruption.

"It's a gold mine," the official said.

Following the arrest, Mr. Salehi called Mr. Karzai directly from his cell to demand that he be freed. Mr. Karzai twice sent
delegations to the detention center where Mr. Salehi was held. After seven hours, Mr. Salehi was let go.

Afterward, Gen. Nazar Mohammed Nikzad, the head of the Afghan unit investigating Mr. Salehi, was summoned to the

Presidential Palace and asked by Mr. Karzai to explain his actions.

"Everything is lawful and by the book," a Western official said of the Afghan anticorruption investigators. "They gather
the evidence, they get the warrant signed off — and then the plug gets pulled every time."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771377 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

This is not the first time that Afghan prosecutors have run into resistance when they have tried to pursue an Afghan
official on corruption charges related to New Ansari.

Sediq Chekari, the minister for Hajj and Religious Affairs, was allowed to flee the country as investigators prepared to

charge him with accepting bribes in exchange for steering business to tour operators who ferry people to Saudi Arabia
each year. Mr. Chekari fled to Britain, officials said. Afghanistan's attorney general issued an arrest warrant through

Interpol.

American officials say a key player in the scandal is Hajji Rafi Azimi, the vice chairman of Afghan United Bank. The bank's

chairman, Hajji Mohammed Jan, is a founder of New Ansari. According to American officials, Afghan prosecutors would
like to arrest Mr. Azimi but so far have run into political interference they did not specify. He has not been formally

charged.

In the past, some Western officials have expressed frustration at the political resistance that Afghan prosecutors have
encountered when they have tried to investigate Afghan officials. Earlier this year, the American official said that the

Obama administration was considering extraordinary measures to bring corrupt Afghan officials to justice, including
extradition.

"We are pushing some high-level public corruption cases right now, and they are just constantly stalling and stalling and

stalling," the American official said of the Karzai administration.

Another Western official said he was growing increasingly concerned about the morale — and safety — of the Afghan
anticorruption prosecutors.

So far, the Afghan prosecutors have not folded. The Salehi case is likely to resurface — and very soon. Under Afghan law,
prosecutors have a maximum of 33 days to indict an individual after his arrest. Mr. Salehi was arrested in late July.

That means Afghan prosecutors may soon come before the Afghan attorney general, Mohammed Ishaq Aloko, to seek

an indictment. It will be up to Mr. Aloko, who owes his job to Mr. Karzai, to sign it.

"They are all just doing their jobs," the Western official said. "They are scared for their lives. They are scared for their
families. If it continues, they will eventually give up the fight."

Haitian activists want Obama to address immigration

goals

With President Barack Obama coming to Miami, some Haitian-American activists want
him to address the issue of Temporary Protected Status.

BY LESLEY CLARK AND JACQUELINE CHARLES
LCLARK@MIAMIHERALD.COM
WASHINGTON -- Haitian-American and immigrant activists who greeted President Barack Obama's election with

high hopes are growing frustrated with the administration's failure to deliver one of their top goals.

Obama said in July he was "very sympathetic" to the community's request to allow Haitian immigrants now illegally
in the country to stay temporarily, but no decision has been announced. Some activists say their patience is wearing

thin.

"I feel they are stringing us along, and we are in an awkward position," said Randolph McGrorty, head of Catholic
Charities Legal Services, who brought the subject to a head with a stinging e-mail sent to House, Senate and

administration staffers last week. "Do we allow them to string us along because they are our allies or do we start
calling them on the carpet for it?"

The unrest comes as Obama plans a trip to Miami on Monday to raise money for House and Senate Democrats.

Presidential candidate Obama did not promise to grant undocumented Haitian immigrants temporary legal status in
the United States -- a designation known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS -- but activists said they believed
the first African-American president would give the issue special consideration.

Instead, former President Bill Clinton -- a United Nations special envoy to the country -- and the United Nations have
taken the lead in rebuilding a storm-battered Haiti after last year's four back-to-back storms that killed hundreds and
left nearly $1 billion in damages.

CHALLENGE

The issue of TPS poses a challenge for Rep. Kendrick Meek, a Miami Democrat who is depending on a robust
tumout in the politically active Haitian-American community to boost his Senate bid. But critics say South Florida's

congressional Democrats, including Meek, have not been as vocal about pushing the Obama administration on Haiti
as they were during the Bush administration.

 Meek, who represents the largest group of Haitian-American voters in the United States, said Friday he's had

 meetings with the administration and is optimistic that it is taking a serious look at the policy.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767000 Date: 07/31/2015</span>

  It may not come as soon as we want to, but I can tell you the Obama administration has made steps the Bush
administration wouldn't have made in 100 years," Meek said, noting that the administration has temporarily stayed

deportations of noncriminals to Haiti. "The ultimate goal is to have Haiti in a position where Haitians can stay in
Haiti and not take to the sea."

Still, Broward Democrat Rep. Alcee Hastings chastised the administration last week, looking to prod it by attaching
an amendment to a Coast Guard spending bill that would require the agency to review the effect of changing
immigration policy toward Haiti. Critics have suggested TPS could lead Haitians to rush to the U.S. shore.

"Temporary Protected Status or some other comparable relief for our Haitian neighbors is long overdue and this
administration has been stalling for far too long," Hastings said in support of his amendment.

He said the review would "hopefully help us show that our government has rationally and realistically examined all
possible scenarios and we are well-equipped to contend with any possible effects."

U.S. POLICY

When Obama brought up the issue in July, he said the administration is reviewing U.S. policy on deporting
undocumented Haitians, suggesting that the issue would be "part of a broader conversation about immigration."

But immigration groups say the pace on overhauling the nation's immigration system is too slow and fear no

progress next year during a volatile election.

The White House this week referred questions on TPS to the Department of Homeland Security, which said it had

made no changes in policy, adding that, "no one should attempt to come to the U.S. in the hopes of being granted
TPS.

Advocates for Haitian Americans, including Cheryl Little, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy

Center, said they've written a number of letters and e-mails to the administration seeking a response to their request
for TPS -- and in recent months have offered less-sweeping alternatives to TPS to help the estimated 35,000

undocumented Haitians currently living in legal limbo.

"Washington needs to know we are not going to fade into the woodwork," Little said. "We are going to continue to
make the case for TPS and be critical of this administration when they don't do the right thing."

ADVOCATE

Earlier this month, Little appealed to former President Clinton who, during two appearances in Miami recently, spoke
of his support for TPS. He said if the decision was up to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, "it would have been

done. Hillary strongly supports this."

A spokesman for the State Department declined to comment on Clinton's remarks, saying they were the former

president's "personal comments" and it would be "inappropriate for us to make any official declarations on the
issue" since the decisions are being made by Homeland Security.

Advocates acknowledge the administration has quietly made some changes. It has temporarily suspended the

deportation of noncriminal, undocumented Haitians. Undocumented Haitians with no criminal records who are
detained by immigration authorities are being released from detention centers as long as they agree to a final order

of removal.

Once released, they can apply for work permits but must periodically check in with immigration authorities until they
are eventually deported.

'BABY STEPS'

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767000 Date: 07/31/2015</span>

But critics dismiss the changes as "baby steps," noting that by not granting undetained migrants a chance to apply

for work permits, they're unable to support themselves or assist struggling families back home. An impoverished
Haiti is dependent on remittances from abroad.

"That is not nearly enough," Little said. "That is not even a half-hearted attempt at doing the right thing here."

The Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition met Wednesday to discuss the issue and plans to protest at Obama's

fundraiser in Miami on Monday. Haitian activists protested outside the White House last month.

"As far as we are concerned, regarding Haiti, the Obama administration is maintaining the same status quo as the

Bush immigration policy," said Jean-Robert Lafortune, the coalition's president.

 BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The European Union said on Sunday it plans to invite Israeli and Palestinian
 representatives to meet "in the coming days" to discuss resuming peace negotiations.

     The announcement by Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security

 Policy, was made after a meeting of the Middle East Quartet - the EU, the United States, Russia and the United
 Nations.

     The Quartet discussed what to do next to encourage the two sides to resume "substantive" negotiations as
 soon as possible.

     Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has demanded that Israel halt all settlement building in the occupied

  West Bank before Palestinians will restart talks. But Israel has made clear it is not ready to do that.

     Last month, Abbas formally asked the United Nations to recognise a Palestinian state in the West Bank and

  Gaza Strip, a move opposed by Israel and the United States. They say only a negotiated peace can end the
  Middle East conflict and create a Palestinian state alongside Israel.

     In Jerusalem, an Israeli official contacted by Reuters would not comment on the planned invitation, but
  suggested Israel would be ready to attend.

     Israel has "repeatedly expressed its willingness to start direct peace talks with the Palestinians face to face

  without any preconditions whatsoever," the official said. He added: "We hope the Palestinians will be ready,
  too."

Re: Qaddafi fears interim government

Latest report:

During the afternoon of March 6, advisors to Muammar al-Qaddafi and his son Saif al Islam stated in
confidence that, while Qaddafi himself remains confident that his forces can gain the upper hand against rebel
forces throughout the country, Saif is increasingly concerned that the rebels will form an interim government
that will give the United States and the nations of Western Europe a focal point for providing both military and

humanitarian aid to the rebels. Saif is encouraging his father to continue to speak out accusing the rebels of
being puppets of these Western states. By the same token, Saif has instructed government spokesmen to return
to the idea that, if this revolution succeeds, Islamist groups such as al Qa'ida and the Libyan Fighting Group

(LFG), which Qaddafi has suppressed, will use Libya as a base for attacking the Western states and their
allies. Saif believes that pressing these two themes will, if nothing else, confuse the foreign governments, and
complicate their efforts to aid the rebels.

(Source Comment: One source with access to Saif stated that word had spread through the Qaddafi government
that NATO special forces troops —either Dutch or German -- had been captured by government forces outside of

Tripoli on 4 or 5 March. Their sources also reported they believe 8-10 British troops had been taken into

           <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05785618 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

ustody by rebel forces in Benghazi on 4 March. Similar reports have appeared in the press, but there is no

 dependent confirmation.)

Lsof 6 March, Qaddafi's military advisors, including his sons Montasem and Khamis are warning Qadddfi that
le 1500-2000 person rebel force advancing from Benghazi toward Tripoli presents the most immediate threat
) the regime. They are particularly concerned by the situation in Misrata, warning that if the rebels can

onsolidate their hold on this town, they will be able to threaten Sirte, the base of Qaddafi's tribe, the
?adhafah. According to some advisors, Qaddafi views Sirte as a fallback position if he cannot remain in
'ripoli; loss of this town would be a serious Psychological and Strategic blow to the regime. Government
Drees have used attack helicopters and ground support aircraft to attack the rebel forces at Misrata and, while
ley have been unable to secure the town, they have inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels and slowed their

dvance on Sirte.

Source Comment: Individuals with access to Qaddafi's military advisors believe government forces will make
 creasing use of their attack helicopters and the 250 combat air craft still under their control. They also state
iat Qaddafi believes that the rebels may soon receive more sophisticated anti-aircraft weapons from the
Vestern allies; weapons which will offset the government's air superiority. This would be particularly true in

le case of attack helicopters, which are vulnerable to modern, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles.)

?addafi also wants his forces to continue to tie down rebel troops in and around the town of Zawiyah, 30 miles
test of Tripoli and any facilities that it can reach in the rebel held areas in the western part of the
ountry. Qaddafi is pleased with the performance of his troops, but according to these individuals he is
oncerned that Western governments, particularly the United States will soon begin to provide active support to

le rebel forces.

adividuals advising Mustafa Abdul Galil, the former Libyan Minister of Justice, and the current leader of the
.pposition National Libyan Council, (NLC), stated in confidence that Galil is now convinced that the NLC must
arm an Interim Government, and establish relations with the Western powers and the members of the Arab
,eague. Galil recognizes that the independent students and workers who make up the majority of the rebels,

articularly those engaged in fighting Qaddafi's forces, as well as various tribal leaders, including Senussiyyah
amily of former King Idriss, warn against this step. That said, Galil believes that without a major increase in
Vestern aid, the situation will deteriorate into a civil war with no end in sight.

Source Comment: Advisors to Saif al Islam Qaddafi added that his father will not leave Libya, and would
ather sacrifice his life in fighting the rebels, rather than turn over the country to the opposition forces. Also,

 aif believes that the current forces loyal to his father will support him in this effort, as well as allies in Syria,
Lfrica, and among the Algerian military.)

Published Thursday, January 12, 2012

The US presidential election campaign that kicked off January 3 with the Iowa caucuses
was the subject of a curious article attacking President Barack Obama in the mass
circulation Israeli daily newspaper, Israel Hayom.
"US President Barack Obama is 'naïve' and needs to face up to the threat presented by
the rise of the MuslimBrotherhood across the Middle East, Israel's National Security

Council concluded during a strategic discussion several days ago,"  Israel Havom reported.
The Israeli National Security Council consists of Benjamin "Bibi" Netanyahu's closest
advisers. AndIsrael Hayom    is not just another right-leaning Israeli tabloid. Referred to by
Israelis as the "Bibiton," or Bibi's mouthpiece, the paper is an instrument that gives him

extraordinary political leverage. The obviously planted article insrael Hayom  rang like a
bell sounding the start of Netanyahu's own campaign in helping the Republican Party oust
Obama from the White House.
Israel Hayom's  genesis demonstrates the depth of Netanyahu's connections in

Republican circles. It was created by one of Netanyahu's top financial supporters, a Las
Vegas-based casino tycoon named Sheldon Adelson, who is also a major donor to the

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793511 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

conservative wing of the Republican Party. Adelson's closest relationship is with former
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, a longtime ally of Netanyahu who has been running
a rancorous campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

Netanyahu's less than subtle intervention has become an open issue in Israeli politics.
Opposition leader Tzipi Livni of the Kadima Party has criticized Netanyahu for damaging
the US-Israeli relationship. "Netanyahu spoke about consensus," Livni said in May, "and if
there is a consensus in Israel, it's that the relationship with the US is essential to Israel,

and a prime minister that harms the relationship with the US over something unsubstantial
is harming Israel's security and deterrence."
But Livni's warning has been ignored. Rather than hesitating, the prime minister and his
inner circle are moving full steamahead in their political shadow campaign whose ultimate
goal is to remove Obama. Bibi's war against Obama is unprecedented. While Israeli prime

ministers have tried to help incumbent presidents, none have ever waged a full-scale
campaign to overthrowthem.
Netanyahu has engaged enthusiastic allies in the Republican Congress, led by House
Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and within the right-wing media. His neoconservative allies in
Washington are launching a "Super PAC" to generate emotional attack ads against

Obama and any candidate that might be an obstacle to his policies. And his campaign has
even broadened into an attempt to discredit theNew York Times, whose editorial page
and foreign policy columnists, Thomas Friedman and Roger Cohen, have been critical of
him.

Netanyahu's shadow campaign is intended to be a factor in defeating Obama and electing
a Republican in his place. He opposed Obama's early demand to freeze settlements on
the West Bank as a precondition for reviving the peace process, a process since the Oslo
Accord that Netanyahu has attempted to stall or sabotage, despite his signing of the Wye
Agreement under pressure from President Clinton. Since his adamant stand against the

settlement freeze, Netanyahu has undermined every effort to engage the peace process.
He appears dead set on consolidating Greater Israel, or what many Israelis call "Judea
and Samaria," and has signaled a strong desire to attack Iran.
By all accounts, Netanyahu's personal chemistry with Obama is toxic. Obama bristles at
his belligerence. But Netanyahu's hostility has reaped rewards fromhim, having stopped

the peace process in its tracks. The latest effort by the Quartet seems doomed to failure.
And Netanyahu's rejectionism has put Obama on the defense. Most of the US Jewish
establishment has remained a bulwark for Bibi's policies. Obama, meanwhile, has been
forced to declare America's "unshakable bond" with Israel, even as Bibi thwarts Obama's
initiatives and attacks himin the Israeli press.

As political strategy, by tainting Obama as less than full-throated in support of Israel,
Netanyahu bolsters the Republican themes that the president "apologizes" for US power,
is weak on national security, and is an agent of "decline." By depicting Obama as "weak"
on Israel, Netanyahu's campaign excites right-wing Jews and evangelical Christians, who
overwhelmingly accept the biblical claims of the Jewish state's historical right to Greater

Israel, Judea and Samaria. Bibi's deepest attack line against Obama merges theology
withideology.
 His campaign against Obama is a high-stakes gambit that will almost certainly color US-
 Israeli relations well past Election Day. Already, Netanyahu has succeeded in polarizing
 the political debate, as his agenda is singularly aligned with the Republican Party. Yet

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793511 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

Bibi's short-termobjectives are rapidly turning the US-Israel relationship, at least under his
aegis, into a partisan issue, another litmus test of conservative ideology rather than

national interest.
The personal connection
Netanyahu's American orientation is partly rooted in his personal history. Raised in
suburban Philadelphia, his father, Benzion Netanyahu, was the former press secretary for
the godfather of right-wing revisionist Zionism, Zeev Jabotinsky. Benzion Netanyahu

(original name: Benzion Mileikowsky) spent his most consequential years in New York
raising money for Jabotinsky and the rightist lrgun militia in Palestine. When he returned
to Israel to launch a political career, the elder Netanyahu was rejected by Menachem
Begin, the Likud Party leader, who, as right wing as he was, considered himdangerously

extreme (Arabs are "an enemy by essence," the elder Netanyahu said recently). But the
son triumphed where his father failed, rising at first on his fluency in American political
culture, a frequent guest on ABC News' Nightline and other US broadcast news programs,
eventually winning the chairmanship of the Likud Party in 1992.
The following year, Netanyahu published a political manifesto in the formof a memoir,    A

Durable Peace,   edited with a helping hand fromAmerican neoconservative Douglas Feith.
The book was tailored to the sensibilities of an American audience, particularly one with
conservative Republican tendencies. In a revealing passage, Netanyahu warned readers
that the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state could lead Latinos to establish a "second
Mexico" in the American Southwest: "These [Latinos] would demand not merely equality

before the law, or naturalization, or even Spanish as a first language," he wrote. "Instead
they would say that since they forma local majority in the territory [which was forcibly
taken from Mexico in the war of 1848], they deserve a state of their own."
In 1996, when Netanyahu launched an underdog bid for Prime Minister against the grand
old man of the Labor Party establishment, Shimon Peres, he contracted the services of

Arthur Finkelstein, a reclusive New York-based Republican political consultant. Finkelstein
was infamous for orchestrating a come-from-behind victory in 1992 for Jesse Helms, a
radical neo-Confederate senator from North Carolina, by race baiting Helms' black
opponent. Finkelstein earned a fortune working for anti-gay candidates like Helms, even
while planning to marry his long-termboyfriend.

Netanyahu's campaign against Peres was defined by Finkelstein's trademark slashing
tactics. Frightening imagery flooded Israeli airwaves. Among Netanyahu's most successful
Finkelstein-crafted attack lines was, "Peres will divide Jerusalem." Even the positive
slogans had a negative subtext. "Bibi is good for the Jews," hinted darkly at the de facto
coalition Peres had constructed with Arab-based political parties. Finkelstein's media

assault on Peres, with its suggestion that he and his assassinated predecessor, Yitzhak
Rabin, had stabbed Israel in the back, propelled his client to a narrow victory.
The new Prime Minister relied on a kitchen cabinet of advisers fromneoconservative think
tanks, especially the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the
Shalem Center. In 1996, two of these advisers, former Reagan administration Pentagon

officials, Richard Perle and Douglas Feith, produced a document for Institute for Advanced
 Strategic and Political Studies, a once influential base of neocon activity, called "A Clean
 Break." The paper advocated overthrowing Saddam Hussein and attacking Syria "as a
 prelude to a redrawing of the map of the Middle East." (Feith was appointed a Defense
 Department official in the George W Bush administration and became a fervent defender

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793511 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

of the Iraq invasion, leading the effort to fabricate evidence of SaddamHussein's
operational links with al-Qaeda. General Tommy Frank, who led the invasion, called Feith

"the fk*king stupidest guy on the face of the earth.")
Backing down to Clinton
President Bill Clinton was, according to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee
(AIPAC)'s then-President Steve Grossman, "the most pro-Israeli [president] in America's
history" – and he was committed to fulfilling the Oslo Accords on his watch. He developed

an unusually close relationship with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, coming to see himas
something of a father figure. When Rabin was assassinated by a right-wing Orthodox
Jewish extremist, Peres briefly took over, but was soon defeated by Netanyahu. Clinton
demanded that Netanyahu begin to withdraw Israeli troops fromsmall portions of land in

the occupied West Bank. With pressure mounting, Netanyahu flung himself into the
American political wars.
In January 1998, at the beginning of the impeachment scandal, Netanyahu appeared at a
rally organized by Reverend Jerry Falwell, a right-wing evangelical Christian icon, who
had produced an elaborate conspiracy video accusing Clinton of drug trafficking and

complicity in the murder of Vince Foster, his White House deputy legal counsel and old
friend, who had, in fact, committed suicide.
Standing beside Falwell before an audience of hundreds of evangelical activists and right-
wing Jews, Netanyahu vowed in his signature basso profondo voice never to "divide"
Jerusalem, and proclaimed that the "Jewish people" were being "vilified and scorned and

misrepresented." After the rally, Netanyahu shuttled between meetings with conservative
pundits and the broadcast studios of Fox News and right-wing Christian TV networks,
stirring up his support among America's most zealous opponents of the peace process.
The most prominent among Netanyahu's newfound conservative allies was then-House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, an instigator of the impeachment. That April, at a meeting of the

Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, Gingrich condemned Clinton's attempts to pressure
Netanyahu into land-for-peace concessions. "The idea that the President can propose a
US map [regarding Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank] for a country he does not know
is a disaster," Gingrich said. Then he complained, "The Clinton administration has not held
[Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser] Arafat's feet to the fire."

But, by October 1998, Netanyahu had all but caved to Clinton's pressure. The man who
once mocked "advocates of capitulation" nowclasped hands with Arafat after a protracted
conference at Wye, Maryland. Netanyahu agreed to redeploy Israeli troops from 13
percent of the West Bank, including most of Hebron. His sudden turnabout cost himkey
support inside Likud, provoking a Knesset vote for early elections. His right-wing base

shattered, paving the path for a decisive victory for the Labor Party's Ehud Barak, a former
Israeli general favored and quietly supported by the Clinton administration.
 Suddenly in the wilderness, Netanyahu plotted his path back by cultivating the right-wing
in the US — the pundits, the Republican politicians, the big donors, Fox News. In 2007, he
 held a meeting with a small group of conservative activists emerging as key players in the

conservative blogosphere. Among those present was Andrew Breitbart, who became a
 notorious hatchet man staging wild stunts and whose myriad websites routinely carry
 conspiratorial, racially charged attacks on Obama. Other figures at the meeting included
 conservative bloggers Scott Johnson, JimHoft and Jeff Emmanuel. "At our meeting we

 talked mostly about the dangers of the Iranian regime acquiring a nuclear bomb," Johnson

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793511 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

recalled, revealing his newly acquired foreign policy expertise. "It was a subject to which
Netanyahu had obviously devoted great thought."
Two years later, Netanyahu returned to the Prime Minister's office at the head of an even

more decidedly right-wing coalition than before government and was determined not to
repeat his previous mistakes of "capitulating" to the peace process at the behest of an
American president. Now he turned to the movement he had courted to help him
undermine and humiliate Obama.
Humiliating Obama

In March 2010, when Obama dispatched Vice President Joseph Biden to Israel in a futile
attempt to restart negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Netanyahu
appeared in Jerusalem at a massive rally of 1,000 evangelicals organized by Texas mega-
church Pastor John Hagee, a leading Christian Zionist and sometime Holocaust revisionist

whose End Times theology committed him to the vision of Greater Israel. Seated onstage
beside Netanyahu was Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren (a
neoconservative former Shalem Center fellow), and Deputy Foreign Minister Danny
Ayalon, who had just snubbed a visiting delegation of leading Democratic members of
Congress. Before the rapture-ready audience, Netanyahu proclaimed that Jerusalem

would remain "the undivided, eternal capital of the Jewish people."
At once, he authorized the construction of 1,600 new settlement units in occupied East
Jerusalemover the stringent objections fromthe Obama administration. Though the move
angered the White House, Ron Dermer, a top Netanyahu aide with close ties to leading
Republicans in Washington, reassured the Prime Minister that Republicans would retake

Congress. Netanyahu simply rejected Obama's plea to freeze settlements and then
rejected overtures to restart the peace process. In the 2010 mid-term elections,
Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives.
While on a trip to New York days after the Republican victory, Netanyahu authorized
another 1,000 more settlement units in East Jerusalem, a direct rebuke of Obama. That

same day, Netanyahu held a meeting with the incoming House Majority Leader Eric
Cantor, the only Jewish Republican in Congress, and a leader of the right-wing in the
 House Republican Conference. Cantor's office produced a summary of the meeting for the
 media that contained the remarkably crude statement: Cantor promised Netanyahu that
"the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the [Obama] Administration and

 what has been, up until this point, one party rule in Washington."
 In April 2011, Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner personally invited
 Netanyahu to speak before a joint session of Congress. He was interrupted 36 times by
 standing ovations —more than Obama during his State of the Union address —despite
 making such mind-boggling false claims as that the "vast majority" of Israeli settlers live in

 "neighborhoods in Jerusalemand greater Tel Aviv."
 With a rancorous, multi-billion dollar US presidential campaign certainly looming on the
 horizon, Netanyahu continued his pattern of making friends in the radical right's media
 machine. Among them was Glenn Beck, a Mormon convert and former Fox News host,
 who had compared a major liberal Jewish religious denomination to radical Islamists and

 claimed that Obama has "a deep-seated hatred for white people." Beck was admonished
 by the Anti-Defamation League and other mainstreamJewish groups for his anti-Semitic
 rants against George Soros, a major funder of liberal and Democratic Party-related
 organizations. In July 2011, Beck traveled to Israel to deliver a diatribe against liberal

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793511 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

Israelis demonstrating against Netanyahu's economic policies, labeling thempatsies in a
secret Islamist-Communist plot.
When the right-wing Zionist Organization of America honored Beck this November with a

prize named after Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, Netanyahu displayed his
gratitude in a videotaped tribute. "Glenn, you can be sure that if Sheldon and Miri Adelson
put their name to something, it must stand for a lot. You stand for a lot...And I want to tell
you howdeeply we appreciate this stand of courage and integrity."

Dear Sasha
In December, Thomas Friedman, the Pulitzer Prize winning      New York Times'   former
JerusalemBureau Chief and one of the few American columnists whose opinions
seriously register in the Israeli media, published a,uncharacteristically pointed critique of
Netanyahu's leadership. In Friedman's column were two lines that incited the wrath and

fury of the Prime Minister's office. "I sure hope that Israel's prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, understands that the standing ovation he got in Congress this year was not for
his politics. That ovation was bought and paid for by the Israel lobby."
Neoconservative opinion makers exploded with orchestrated rage accusing Friedman of
being a self-hating Jewish anti-Semite. In response, the
                                                          New York Times gave Netanyahu
an opportunity to respond on its opinion page.
But rather than accept theTimes' offer, Netanyahu dispatched Ron Dermer, his key
emissary to the American political scene, especially to the conservative movement, now
serving as a senior advisor on his staff, to issue what amounted to a declaration of war

against the American newspaper of record. Dermer's letter was extraordinary in its
vitriolic, hostile and contemptuous tone. Nothing like it had ever existed before —a vicious
official attack fromthe Prime Minister of Israel on the credibility of tNew York Times.
Perhaps only a little less surprising was that this major event received nearly no coverage
in the American press.
In his scathing letter, Dermer accused theTimes
                                                   of "cavalierly defam[ing] our country,"
claiming that 19 out of 20 op-eds published in the  Times were "negative" (Dermer did not
challenge their factual basis). He concluded, "it would seemas if the surest way to get an
op-ed published in theNew York Times      these days, no matter how obscure the writer or
the viewpoint, is to attack Israel."
One of the remarkable aspects of Dermer's letter was that it was addressed, "Dear

Sasha." Who is Sasha? Sasha Polakow-Suransky, a staff editor at the      Times editorial
page, is in charge of assigning pieces on foreign policy. Why did Dermer address his letter
to Polakow-Suransky instead of to Andrew Rosenthal, the director of the    Times editorial
page? Was he singling out Polakow-Suransky because he revealed in his 2010 book,         The

Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Relationship With Apartheid South Africa,    that. Israel
offered to sell nuclear warheads to South Africa's apartheid government, a bombshell
revelation that prompted furious denials fromIsraeli President Shimon Peres and Deputy
Prime Minister Dan Meridor, embarrassing a country that still refuses to discuss its nuclear
programin any public forums, and punishes those who do?

Netanyahu's attack on the   Times represented a significant new stage in his shadow war.
He was drawing sharp new lines. By rebuking the paper, Netanyahu attempted to define
its liberal Zionist, pro-peace process editorial line as hostile to Israeli security needs. And
by default, he positioned Rupert Murdoch'sWall Street Journal,    with its relentlessly anti-
Obama, pro-Bibi op-ed page, as the only respectable forumfor true friends of Israel.

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793511 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

Bibi's man in Washington
More than any other candidate in the Republican presidential contest, Newt Gingrich has

hewed to Netanyahu's line on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In an interview with the cable
TV Jewish Channel, Gingrich declared, "We've had an invented Palestinian people who
are in fact Arabs and are historically part of the Arab community and they had a chance to
go many places." He added, "I see myself as, in many ways, to be pretty close to Bibi
Netanyahu in thinking about the dangers of the world."

In May 2010, when Gingrich's presidential' campaign was no more than the subject of
guarded speculation, Israel Hayom,   Bibi's house organ, provided Gingrich with a Hebrew-
language forum to assail Obama's policies. The tabloid splashed a full page photo of a
smiling Gingrich on its front page accompanied by the caption: "The former Chairman of

the House of Representatives attacks the blindness of the Western Elites: `Evading the
confrontation with Evil may bring a second Holocaust, the mistakes made by the White
House will exact a terrible price."
Israel Hayom's owner, Las Vegas Sands casino corporation chairman Sheldon Adelson, is
America's eighth wealthiest man. At the same time he was bankrolling Netanyahu's

career, Adelson also became Gingrich's leading financial angel. The casino kingpin was
introduced to Gingrich in 1996 through George Harris, a right-wing anti-tax activist and
Clark County, Nevada Republican chairman who helped Adelson block a unionization bid
at one of his casinos. Gingrich resigned fromCongress in disgrace in 1999, forced out by
Republicans, hiding his extramarital affair with a congressional staffer. Adelson stepped in

as his financial godfather, pumping millions into the coffers of American Solutions for
Winning the Future, an independent political committee that covered Gingrich's
extravagant travel expenses.
When Gingrich embarked on the presidential trail, George Harris became his campaign
finance co-chair, representing Adelson by proxy. (Adelson's Sands corporation is currently

facing a federal criminal probe for allegedly bribing foreign officials). And when Gingrich
provoked a hailstormof criticismfor claiming the Palestinians were "invented," Adelson
publicly defended him. "Read the history of those who call themselVes Palestinians, and
you will hear why [Newt] Gingrich said recently that the Palestinians are an invented
people," Adelson told a group of American Jews visiting Israel on a programhe funds,

Taglit-Birthright Israel.
Despite Gingrich's dismal finish in the Iowa caucuses, the opening contest in the
Republican contest, Adelson has staunchly remained on his side, donating US$5 million to
a Super PAC created to support Gingrich's campaign in the key primary state of South
Carolina, his Armageddon.

Bibi's Super PAC
When Gingrich quits the race, Netanyahu will not be without a candidate. He can count on
former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney to carry the neoconservative banner all the
way to Election Day. Of Romney's 22 campaign foreign policy advisers, 15 worked in the
administration of George WBush, and six were original members of the Project for the

New American Century, the neoconservative group that called for regime change in Iraq.
Romney's own Super PAC, Restore Our Future, credited with destroying Gingrich's hopes
in Iowa through a relentless barrage of negative ads, is financed in part by Mel Sembler, a
Florida-based a multi-millionaire shopping mall developer and veteran Republican
fundraiser, appointed the US ambassador to Italy by President George W Bush. Sembler

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793511 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

was mired in scandal when the federal government revoked the license of a chain of
adolescent treatment centers he founded after former teenage patients complained they
were sexually abused, psychologically tortured and humiliated during sadistic behavior

modification programs. Less well known is the financial largesse Sembler has bestowed
on neoconservative outfits supporting Netanyahu's policies. He is also a close friend of
Adelson.
In November 2011, President Obama and French President Nicolas Sarkozy

commiserated about Netanyahu, unaware that their voices were picked up by a live
microphone. "You're fed up with him, but I have to deal with himeven more often than
you," Obama complained to Sarkozy. Romney seized on the episode as pi-oof of Obama's
disqualifying leadership and proof of his own fitness for office. "We have here yet another
reason why we need new leadership in the White House," Romney declared. (Joining the

chorus of pro-Bibi attacks on Obama were the Netanyahu-approved bloggers Breitbart       ,
Hoft, and Johnson).
In ramping up the effort to turn Israel into an anti-Obama wedge issue, a group of
neoconservative Netanyahu allies have started a independent political committee called

the Emergency Committee for Israel (ECI). The group's name was inspired by the
Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People of Europe, an organization that
Netanyahu's father, Benzion, helped lead during World War II in part to raise money for
the right-wing Irgun militia in Palestine. The group's board comprises a Who's Who of
Washington neoconservatives. It is directed by Noah Pollak, a former assistant editor of

Azure,  the in-house journal of the Adelson-funded Shalem Center, several of whose
fellows are nowin Netanyahu's inner circle of adviserS. Pollak was credited with helping
the Israeli army launch a YouTube channel to rebut accusations that it committed war
crimes in the Gaza Strip and elsewhere.
This month, the ECI established a Super PAC in order to use unlimited corporate

contributions for political attack ads. The group's first major presidential campaign ad buy
targeted Representative Ron Paul (R-Texas), a fervently anti-war libertarian candidate
who has called for an end to the special relationship between Israel and the United States.
Scheduled to air in the key primary state of South Carolina, where the Republican
electorate is dominated by right-wing evangelicals, the ad features Gary Bauer, an ECI

board member, Christian right leader and failed presidential candidate staring into the
camera, warning that "Ron Paul's conservatismis isolationist and conspiratorial." (Bauer
endorsed former Senator Rick Santorum, a right-wing Catholic, who has declared, "All the
people that live in the West Bank are Israelis. They are not Palestinians. There is no
Palestinian. This is Israeli land.")

Jewish concerns
While Obama and the Democratic Party elite have kept silent in the face of Netanyahu's
American shadow war, its polarizing effects have prompted resistance froman
unexpected place: the Jewish-American establishment. Weeks of Republican attacks on
Obama for his supposed molly-coddling of Israel enemies caused deep discomfort in the

offices of mainstreamJewish groups, which have lobbied for decades to consolidate
support for Israel in both major American political parties. With Israel deliberately being
shaped into a campaign wedge issue, some Jewish leaders worried that rank-and-file
Democratic voters would begin to sour on the US-Israel special relationship.

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793511 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

In October, two of the US's oldest and most prominent Jewish organizations, the Anti-
Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee, released a "National Pledge for
Unity" urging politicians, religious leaders and other Jewish groups aimed at preserving

bipartisan support for Israel. "We want the discourse on US support for Israel to avoid the
sometimes polarizing debates and political attacks that have emerged in recent weeks, as
candidates have challenged their opponents' pro-Israel bone fides or questioned the
current administration's foreign policy approach vis-a-vis Israel," declared Anti-Defamation

League national director Abraham Foxman. "The last thing America and Israel need right
nowis the distractions of having Israel bandied about as a tool for waging political
attacks."
The Emergency Committee for Israel and the Republican Jewish Coalition, an Adelson-
funded, pro-Netanyahu group that claims to raise "tens of millions" of dollars for

Republican candidates each election cycle, not only rejected the unity pledge, but
accused its authors of attempting to suppress pro-Israel activism. In a defiant statement
by its chairman, neoconservative activist WilliamKristol, the ECI proclaimed, "This attempt
to silence those of us who have 'questioned the current administration's foreign policy
approach vis-a-vis Israel' will re-energize us." Thus the show went on. The effort to lower

the temperature only became another occasion for the pro-Netanyahu operation to raise
the heat. As their anti-Obama campaign intensifies, Israel is being merged seamlessly
with traditional right-wing wedge issues such as abortion, gay marriage and the menace of
immigration.

The deepening wedge
In his writings and in the company of his inner circle, Netanyahu has expressed almost as
much disdain for liberal Jewish supporters of Israel as he has for the professed enemies
of the Jewish state. His book,  A Durable Peace,   is filled with attacks on Israeli advocates
of a negotiated peace with the Palestinians, accusing themof "cloying sentimentalism"
and falling victimto the "relentless Jewish desire to see an end to struggle." Netanyahu

was said to privately fume about Obama's Jewish senior advisor, David Axelrod, and his
then-Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, an ardent liberal Zionist whose father was born and
raised in Israel. Netanyahu reportedly called them"self-hating Jews."
After two decades of cultivating the culture warriors of the American right as allies against
those seeking "an end to struggle," Netanyahu is beginning to see results. He initiated and

 propelled a polarization process that has enabled Republicans to use Israel as a cudgel
 for attacking their opponents, and did so over•the objections of powerful mainstream
 Jewish-American interests. HaimMalka, a senior fellow for the center-right Washington-
 based Center for Strategic and International Studies, predicted in a recent paper: "The

 partisan wedge is likely to deepen, posing considerable challenges to Israel and the US-
 Israeli partnership."
 In the past, America's Israel lobby sold the US-Israel alliance as a marriage of two vibrant
 democracies united by shared liberal values. In the current environment of heightened
 polarization, the special relationship is increasingly marketed to Americans as a united

 front of besieged bastions of Western civilization against an incipient Islamic onslaught.
 Rapture ready evangelicals, right-wing ultra-nationalists, and Republican Jews are far

But he is far fromconfident that he can dislodge Obama. Steeling himself for a possible
second Obama term, Netanyahu has signaled his intention to move up the date of Israel's
national election. Hanan Krystal, a political analyst for Israel Radio, explained Netanyahu's

possible motives to Reuters: "At the highest echelons, they have long been saying that if
Obama is elected for a second term, the carrot will be replaced by a stick."

Arm Syria's Rebels

By ROGER COHEN

LONDON —     Here are some home truths about Syria. It's going to get worse before it gets better. Nobody can put this genie back in a

bottle. This is the mother of all proxy fights. The remorseless Assad regime is finished, when it dies being the only question.

Nations get to freedom from tyranny by different routes. When Communism fell, some glided from the Soviet empire into the West as

others agonized. Yugoslavia — a beautiful idea that never worked — is one of several nations being invoked as possible exemplars of

Syria's bloody fate; others include Lebanon and Iraq.

The ingredients are familiar: Syria is a multiethnic state ruled with an iron fist by one minority — the quasi-Shiite Alawites — and

including Christian, Druze and other minorities that between them compose about a quarter of the population. The majority is Sunni.

When the iron fist comes off in countries like this, liberty is more readily seen as getting free of each other than uniting in the give-and-
take of a new liberal order.

So it has proved for a year now in the Syria of Bashar al-Assad who, taking a leaf from his father's book, has attempted to suppress
through mass slaughter the quest of a broad uprising to be free of the family stranglehold. Assad is a doctor by training! No doctor ever

trampled so brazenly on the Hippocratic Oath.

The Assads are a mafia, a minority (the family) within a minority (the Alawites) within a minority (the Mukhabarat secret police). They

co-opted others — notably the Sunni merchant class — through imposed stability, but in essence, like every tyrant dislodged in the Arab

Spring, they have ruled a nation as if it was their personal fiefdom, a plaything to be passed from father to son for the benefit of cousins

and cronies.

Well, that's over. Aleppo is the not the new Marrakesh after all. Those lovely tourism posters on London buses have been packed away.

Arabs have had it with their Godfathers.

I said it's going to get worse before it gets better. The Syrian compact is broken; a new compact under the Assads is inconceivable.

Wider interests are in play. Iranian Shiite theocracy, increasingly isolated, is defending the regime against a Free Syrian Army funded in

part by Saudi Sunni theocracy: that's the proxy war.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05794239 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

Vladimir Putin, fearful of Russian Springs in his own neighborhood, has with signature cynicism opted to defend an old ally against U.S.

demands that Assad go, an objective not pursued with any coherence until now by the Obama administration. Israel knows Assad, who
helps arm Hezbollah but is a predictable and largely passive enemy. It does not know what may lie beyond a security state whose habits

it can predict.

In short, Syria is dangerous. But that not a reason for passivity or incoherence. As the Bosnian war showed, the basis for any settlement

must be a rough equality of forces. So I say step up the efforts, already quietly ongoing, to get weapons to the Free Syrian Army. Train

those forces, just as the rebels were trained in Libya. Payback time has come around: The United States warned Assad about allowing Al

Qaeda fighters to transit Syria to Iraq. Now materiel and special forces with the ability to train a ragtag army can transit Iraq — and

other neighboring states — into Syria. This should be a joint effort of Western and Arab states.

At the same time, mount a big U.N.-coordinated humanitarian effort centered on enclaves for refugees in Turkey, Jordan and

elsewhere, establishing, where possible, safe corridors to these havens.

Push hard to bring Russia and China around: They will not defend Assad beyond the point where that defense looks like a liability for
other bigger interests in the United States, the Gulf and Europe.

I hear the outcry already: Arming Assad's opponents will only exacerbate the fears of Syria's minorities and unite them, ensure greater

bloodshed, and undermine diplomatic efforts now being led by Kofi Annan, a gifted and astute peacemaker. It risks turning a proxy war

into a proxy conflagration.

There is no policy for Syria at this stage that does not involve significant risk. But the only cease-fire I can see that will not amount to an

ephemeral piece of paper is one based on a rough balance of forces. For that, the Free Syrian Army must be armed.

In the end, this course will support, not undermine, Annan's diplomacy and perhaps open the way for the sort of transition outlined by

the Arab League. In return, the divided Syrian opposition must provide a firm commitment to respect the rights of minorities. The
treatment of minorities — like that of women — is one of the many pivotal tests of the Arab Spring.

If Assad falls, Iran is critically weakened. Tehran's established conduit to Hezbollah disappears. Choosing between engineering the
downfall of Assad and bombing Iran's nuclear facilities is really a no-brainer: The former is smart and doable, the latter is folly. Assad's

wife has been buying property in London: Make her use it and make the Syrian people free.

Caitlin/Nora - although the decision has not been finalized, Gov Rendell has probably figured out that the 12
children from the Bresma orphanage will not be approved for humanitarian parole. His staff is stating that one

 of the orphans slated to go to the U.S. has died "within the last few days." I understand that a child at the
 Bresma orphanage died within the last couple of weeks; that child, reportedly, had been matched with a French

 adoptive family. In any event, Gov. Rendell is pushing very hard for the USG to permit the children to travel,
 and dismissing our reasons for not having done so as "bureaucratic."

 Sec. Napolitano's special assistant, Noah Kroloff, has suggested that Secretary Clinton may need to call the
 Governor. I sent an update on the issue this morning (at 1015); nothing has changed since. Please let me

 know what I could provide right now that would be helpful. Michele

Adding Brian and Evan from VP's office, and Cecilia and Straut in IGA.

I just spoke to Gov. Rendell, and he is strongly urging the WH/State Dept. to allow the orphans into the US. He
claims Haitian Government has signed off on it, and US is now standing in the way. He is not open to the
argument that we need to follow protocols, and claims we are being bureaucratic. He says if another orphan

dies, it will be on us.

I would suggest that we need a high-level principal who knows the issue to call the Governor and explain the

importance of our process. Probably, at least initially, 	                       Sec. Napolitano, Raj Shah at            B5
USAID, or Cheryl Mills at State. If that does not calm things down, then perhaps a call from Valerie Jarrett or

VP.

Governor will be coming to DC on Saturday for NGA. Best if we can resolve this quickly, if possible.

Rescue bids had political overtones linked to congressional race
Sunday, January 24, 2010
By Dennis B. Roddy, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

The early stages of efforts to rescue 54 Haitian orphans and bring them to Pittsburgh turned into a
competition with political undertones, secret meetings and a possible foretaste of a coming
congressional race.

Mary Beth Buchanan, the former U.S. attorney for Western Pennsylvania, opened a bid to extract
the children and the sisters from Ben Avon who ran the BRESMA orphanage in Port-au-Prince.

Ms. Buchanan, who has been openly mulling a run for the Republican nomination to challenge

incumbent Rep. Jason Altmire, D-McCandless, spent four days obtaining clearance for the children
to enter the United States, medical supplies for the trip down and back, physicians to escort the
children and -- in the final link that did not fall into place in time -- an airplane cleared to land in

Haiti.

 She said the organizer of the other rescue attempt, Leslie Merrill McCombs, a senior consultant for
 UPMC [University of Pittsburg Medical Center], phoned and grilled her for information, obtained a

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767271 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

list of the children and ended up shipping medical supplies gathered as part of the Buchanan effort
on the plane that carried Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Mr. Altmire.

However the successful rescue was organized, it had the effect of short-circuiting Ms. Buchanan's
effort and shifting attention to Mr. Altmire, a former UPMC lobbyist.

Ms. Buchanan said she started on Thursday, Jan. 14, two days after the quake, by contacting

Jonathan Wander, a local writer who was close with the McMutrie sisters. He put her in touch with
Diana Boni, who is in charge of Haiti adoptions for Kentucky Adoption Services, the company
with legal standing to file a petition for asylum on behalf of the children.

Ms. Buchanan also enlisted Valerie May, a Pittsburgh immigration lawyer. With Ms. Boni, they
assembled a three-part list: BRESMA children close to final adoption; those with prospective
parents but whose adoptions were in the early stages; and children with no current prospects.

Ms. Buchanan also placed a call to an old friend: Dr. Mary Carrasco, director of A Child's Place,

based at UPMC Mercy hospital. Dr. Carrasco, in turn, contacted Kathy McCauley, a grants
consultant who had worked for foundations in the past. Ms. McCauley's job: assemble lists of
medical supplies being gathered for the flight.

The dining room table of the Buchanan home in Fox Chapel became a makeshift headquarters.
Bram Reichbaum, a local blogger, assisted as Ms. Buchanan worked a telephone and computer. She
needed legal clearance to remove the children. She needed an airplane.

By the end of that day, she said, Joseph Klaus, U.S. Customs port director for Pittsburgh, said his
supervisors had given the go-ahead to grant humanitarian parole -- permission to enter the country

as a refugee -- if the children reached Pittsburgh International Airport. By 10:57 a.m. on Friday,
Jan. 15, she had an e-mail from Mr. Klaus confirming it.

Also that Thursday night, Ms. Buchanan said, she was in Ms. May's law offices Downtown when
she returned a call from Ms. McCombs, a social acquaintance.

"She wanted me to know she was also working to save the orphans and she wanted to find out
where I was in the process," said Ms. Buchanan, adding that she briefed Ms. McCombs.

When she offered Dr. Carrasco's contact information, she said, "I got, 'Well, I don't think I'm going
to need that because this is going to be a UPMC effort.' "

Ms. Buchanan said she was thrown.

"I was frustrated at the belief this was a UPMC effort and they didn't need any others. It was clear
to me that her message was UPMC wanted to handle this and they didn't want the assistance of Dr.
Carrasco," she said.

Ms. Buchanan said Ms. McCombs also told her she had talked to the McMutrie family and "the
family was going to fire the adoption agency."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767271 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

"I tried to explain to her that the adoption agency was the legal guardian," Ms. Buchanan said.

Ms. McCombs, however, said Ms. Buchanan called and grilled her for details.

"She's very aggressively asking me what I'm doing," said Ms. McCombs. "So I told her I'd been
working closely with the governor, who had been making this happen. I gave her some of the
details, but not everything."

She also complained that Ms. Buchanan then gave statements to the media about the planned
rescue. When next they spoke, Ms. McCombs said she raised that issue with Ms. Buchanan.

"She was extraordinarily upset with me and very, very rude on the phone. She said UPMC just
wants all the credit," Ms. McCombs said.

As Jamie McMutrie went before a Haitian judge to get clearance for the children to leave the
country, Ms. Buchanan's group was lining up a plane. Officials at United Airlines in Chicago said
they could provide a 160-seat airplane, but needed clearance to land in Haiti.

At the same time, lawyers at the May firm put together an application with the U.S. State
Department on behalf of Ms. Boni and Kentucky Adoption Services, seeking permission to remove
the children from Haiti. It included a list of names and personal data on the orphans they wanted to
bring out.

Dr. Alan Russell, a surgery professor at the University of Pittsburgh who worked on the other plan,
said he concluded that Ms. Buchanan's plan would not work while listening to her conversation
with the Mc1VIurtie family on the night of Friday, Jan. 15.

Dr. Russell said he did not believe Ms. Buchanan had a plane ready to land and that, despite her

assurance that she had waivers for all the orphans to enter the United States, she had only 28.

"Listening in to the phone call I made an informed judgment that our team had secured both things
and we needed to focus to use them. We never competed [with Ms. Buchanan], but we decided to
be very careful about what we promised and we realized that the situation was so fluid that the
'facts' were changing continuously. We did not have time for local politics because the important
political dance had to be played out in Port-au-Prince," Dr. Russell said later.

"I just thought it was more likely that the plan that recognized the complexity of the mission and
that could bring a real congressman [versus someone who was considering running against him]

and a real governor was worth working on."

On Saturday, Jan. 16, the May law firm e-mailed a copy of the application and list to Ms.
Buchanan. She called the May office and asked why Ms. McCombs also had received a copy.

"Leslie McCombs had contacted the law firm the day before and told them that she was working
with us to help rescue the orphans," Ms. Buchanan said.

"The McMutrie family had asked me to contact May Law Group," Ms. McCombs responded.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767271 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

Ms. Buchanan assembled her group on Sunday afternoon in a meeting room at Buchanan Ingersoll,
her husband's law firm. Present, she said, were Dr. Carrasco, Chad McMutrie, a brother of the two
sisters, and members of the medical team being put together by Dr. Carrasco.

During the meeting, United Airlines called Ms. Buchanan to say it could not get in the air the next
day, but would try for Tuesday. Ms. Buchanan said she went home.

"[Dr.] Carrasco called me and said she had been invited to another meeting that was being held by
Leslie McCombs. She said she didn't know the purpose of the meeting," she said.

Ms. Buchanan said she also spoke with Ms. Boni that night.

"She had heard a rumor there was another group trying to get a flight out of Pittsburgh on Monday
into Haiti and she asked me who Leslie McCombs was."

That night, Ms. McCombs presided at a meeting at the China Palace Restaurant in McCandless.
Others who attended included Mr. Altmire and officials from UPMC, Allegheny County human

services officials, Catholic Charities, as well as Dr. Carrasco.

Ms. Buchanan was not among those invited. The e-mail calling the meeting made it clear: the
UPMC team had a plane. The meeting ended with instructions to keep things quiet, leak nothing to
the media, and be at the airport the next morning.

Early Monday morning, Ms. Buchanan received phone calls from reporters: A plane was getting
ready to leave Pittsburgh International.

From South Dakota, Ms. Boni e-mailed Ms. Buchanan, seemingly furious that Ms. McCombs and
her group were about to go to Haiti. Later, Ms. Buchanan said, Ms. Both attempted to relay phone

calls to the plane saying she did not approve.

"My children," she wrote to Ms. Buchanan, "are not available for publicity stunts."

As Mr. Rendell was boarding the airplane, Ms. McCombs recalled, Mr. Altmire told her "this lady
from the adoption agency is trying to stop our flight and saying we're kidnapping the children."

Ms. McCombs said she called Ms. Both to tell her that U.S. authorities were backing the mission,
but said Ms. Both did not believe her.

Shortly before noon the airplane was in the air, heading south.

Ms. Buchanan pleaded with an Allegheny County youth services official to tell her what was going
on. She said he referred her to UPMC's public relations department.

Ms. May, the immigration lawyer, did not figure out until Sunday night that she was working with
two separate missions.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767271 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

"I believed everyone involved was working to get those children out and everyone was genuinely

concerned about the welfare of the children," she said. "It became evident that there was a political
dynamic to this that no one had anticipated."

Ms. Boni, reached last week, called it "unfortunate" that she was kept unaware of the mission that

included Mr. Rendell and Mr. Altmire. But, she said, "regardless of how it was done, it turned out
right."

Joanna,

Out of the 12 children listed who are at the Embassy now, we only have ever heard of 2 of them before.

The other 10 were not on any previous list of children given to us by BRESMA, nor are they in the database in any way. BRESMA
had given us a complete list of all of its children on January 18, including those that were destined for France. None of these children

match with any of those on the previous list except the two, and those two were not destined for France.

We have received one e-mail from a prospective parent for one of these children just today, stating clearly that the match occurred
after January 12. I expect we'll get 8 more e-mails just like this one from the others PAPs in the near term.

The two children we have heard of before were on previous BRESMA lists as "waiting children".

Caitlin/Nora — although the decision has not been finalized, Gov Rendell has probably figured out that the 12 children
from the Bresma orphanage will not be approved for humanitarian parole. His staff is stating that one of the orphans

slated to go to the U.S. has died "within the last few days." I understand that a child at the Bresma orphanage died
within the last couple of weeks; that child, reportedly, had been matched with a French adoptive family. In any event,

Gov. Rendell is pushing very hard for the USG to permit the children to travel, and dismissing our reasons for not having
done so as "bureaucratic."

Sec. Napolitano's special assistant, Noah Kroloff, has suggested that Secretary Clinton may need to call the Governor. I

sent an update on the issue this morning (at 1015); nothing has changed since. Please let me know what I could provide
right now that would be helpful. Michele

Adding Brian and Evan from VP's office, and Cecilia and Straut in IGA.

I just spoke to Gov. Rendell, and he is strongly urging the WH/State Dept. to allow the orphans into the US. He claims
Haitian Government has signed off on it, and US is now standing in the way. He is not open to the argument that we

need to follow protocols, and claims we are being bureaucratic. He says if another orphan dies, it will be on us.

I would suggest that we need a high-level principal who knows the issue to call the Governor and explain the importance
of our process. Probably, at least initially,	                        Sec. Napolitano, Raj Shah at USAID, or Cheryl Mills at

State. If that does not calm things down, then perhaps a call from Valerie Jarrett or VP.

Governor will be coming to DC on Saturday for NGA. Best if we can resolve this quickly, if possible.

Thoughts?

USCIS staff at the Embassy are compiling information about the 12 Bresma children and will report it to USCIS-HQ for
evaluation. The USCIS staff are in contact by email with Ms. McCombs but have not asked her to return to the Embassy

Rescue bids had political overtones linked to congressional race

Sunday, January 24, 2010

By Dennis B. Roddy, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

The early stages of efforts to rescue 54 Haitian orphans and bring them to Pittsburgh turned into a competition with
political undertones, secret meetings and a possible foretaste of a coming congressional race.

Mary Beth Buchanan, the former U.S. attorney for Western Pennsylvania, opened a bid to extract the children and the
sisters from Ben Avon who ran the BRESMA orphanage in Port-au-Prince.

Ms. Buchanan, who has been openly mulling a run for the Republican nomination to challenge incumbent Rep. Jason

Altmire, D-McCandless, spent four days obtaining clearance for the children to enter the United States, medical supplies
for the trip down and back, physicians to escort the children and -- in the final link that did not fall into place in time -- an

airplane cleared to land in Haiti.

She said the organizer of the other rescue attempt, Leslie Merrill McCombs, a senior consultant for UPMC [University of
Pittsburg Medical Center], phoned and grilled her for information, obtained a list of the children and ended up shipping
medical supplies gathered as part of the Buchanan effort on the plane that carried Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Mr.

Altmire.

However the successful rescue was organized, it had the effect of short-circuiting Ms. Buchanan's effort and shifting
attention to Mr. Altmire, a former UPMC lobbyist.

Ms. Buchanan said she started on Thursday, Jan. 14, two days after the quake, by contacting Jonathan Wander, a local

writer who was close with the McMutrie sisters. He put her in touch with Diana Boni, who is in charge of Haiti adoptions
for Kentucky Adoption Services, the company with legal standing to file a petition for asylum on behalf of the children.

Ms. Buchanan also enlisted Valerie May, a Pittsburgh immigration lawyer. With Ms. Boni, they assembled a three-part
list: BRESMA children close to final adoption; those with prospective parents but whose adoptions were in the early

stages; and children with no current prospects.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767274 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

Ms. Buchanan also placed a call to an old friend: Dr. Mary Carrasco, director of A Child's Place, based at UPMC Mercy

hospital. Dr. Carrasco, in turn, contacted Kathy McCauley, a grants consultant who had worked for foundations in the
past. Ms. McCauley's job: assemble lists of medical supplies being gathered for the flight.

The dining room table of the Buchanan home in Fox Chapel became a makeshift headquarters. Bram Reichbaum, a local

blogger, assisted as Ms. Buchanan worked a telephone and computer. She needed legal clearance to remove the
children. She needed an airplane.

By the end of that day, she said, Joseph Klaus, U.S. Customs port director for Pittsburgh, said his supervisors had given
the go-ahead to grant humanitarian parole — permission to enter the country as a refugee -- if the children reached

Pittsburgh International Airport. By 10:57 a.m. on Friday, Jan. 15, she had an e-mail from Mr. Klaus confirming it.

Also that Thursday night, Ms. Buchanan said, she was in Ms. May's law offices Downtown when she returned a call from

Ms. McCombs, a social acquaintance.

"She wanted me to know she was also working to save the orphans and she wanted to find out where I was in the
process," said Ms. Buchanan, adding that she briefed Ms. McCombs.

When she offered Dr. Carrasco's contact information, she said, "I got, 'Well, I don't think I'm going to need that because

this is going to be a UPMC effort.'"

Ms. Buchanan said she was thrown.

"I was frustrated at the belief this was a UPMC effort and they didn't need any others. It was clear to me that her
message was UPMC wanted to handle this and they didn't want the assistance of Dr. Carrasco," she said.

Ms. Buchanan said Ms. McCombs also told her she had talked to the McMutrie family and "the family was going to fire

the adoption agency."

"I tried to explain to her that the adoption agency was the legal guardian," Ms. Buchanan said.

Ms. McCombs, however, said Ms. Buchanan called and grilled her for details.

"She's very aggressively asking me what I'm doing," said Ms. McCombs. "So I told her I'd been working closely with the
governor, who had been making this happen. I gave her some of the details, but not everything."

She also complained that Ms. Buchanan then gave statements to the media about the planned rescue. When next they

spoke, Ms. McCombs said she raised that issue with Ms. Buchanan.

"She was extraordinarily upset with me and very, very rude on the phone. She said UPMC just wants all the credit," Ms.
McCombs said.

As Jamie McMutrie went before a Haitian judge to get clearance for the children to leave the country, Ms. Buchanan's

group was lining up a plane. Officials at United Airlines in Chicago said they could provide a 160-seat airplane, but
needed clearance to land in Haiti.

At the same time, lawyers at the May firm put together an application with the U.S. State Department on behalf of Ms.

Boni and Kentucky Adoption Services, seeking permission to remove the children from Haiti. It included a list of names
and personal data on the orphans they wanted to bring out.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767274 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

Dr. Alan Russell, a surgery professor at the University of Pittsburgh who worked on the other plan, said he concluded
that Ms. Buchanan's plan would not work while listening to her conversation with the McMurtie family on the night of

Friday, Jan. 15.

Dr. Russell said he did not believe Ms. Buchanan had a plane ready to land and that, despite her assurance that she had
waivers for all the orphans to enter the United States, she had only 28.

"Listening in to the phone call I made an informed judgment that our team had secured both things and we needed to

focus to use them. We never competed [with Ms. Buchanan], but we decided to be very careful about what we
promised and we realized that the situation was so fluid that the 'facts' were changing continuously. We did not have

time for local politics because the important political dance had to be played out in Port-au-Prince," Dr. Russell said
later.

"I just thought it was more likely that the plan that recognized the complexity of the mission and that could bring a real

congressman [versus someone who was considering running against him] and a real governor was worth working on."

On Saturday, Jan. 16, the May law firm e-mailed a copy of the application and list to Ms. Buchanan. She called the May
office and asked why Ms. McCombs also had received a copy.

"Leslie McCombs had contacted the law firm the day before and told them that she was working with us to help rescue

the orphans," Ms. Buchanan said.

"The McMutrie family had asked me to contact May Law Group," Ms. McCombs responded.

Ms. Buchanan assembled her group on Sunday afternoon in a meeting room at Buchanan Ingersoll, her husband's law
firm. Present, she said, were Dr. Carrasco, Chad McMutrie, a brother of the two sisters, and members of the medical

team being put together by Dr. Carrasco.

During the meeting, United Airlines called Ms. Buchanan to say it could not get in the air the next day, but would try for
Tuesday. Ms. Buchanan said she went home.

"[Dr.] Carrasco called me and said she had been invited to another meeting that was being held by Leslie McCombs. She

said she didn't know the purpose of the meeting," she said.

Ms. Buchanan said she also spoke with Ms. Boni that night.

"She had heard a rumor there was another group trying to get a flight out of Pittsburgh on Monday into Haiti and she
asked me who Leslie McCombs was."

That night, Ms. McCombs presided at a meeting at the China Palace Restaurant in McCandless. Others who attended

included Mr. Altmire and officials from UPMC, Allegheny County human services officials, Catholic Charities, as well as
Dr. Carrasco.

Ms. Buchanan was not among those invited. The e-mail calling the meeting made it clear: the UPMC team had a plane.

The meeting ended with instructions to keep things quiet, leak nothing to the media, and be at the airport the next
morning.

Early Monday morning, Ms. Buchanan received phone calls from reporters: A plane was getting ready to leave

Pittsburgh International.

 From South Dakota, Ms. Boni e-mailed Ms. Buchanan, seemingly furious that Ms. McCombs and her group were about
to go to Haiti. Later, Ms. Buchanan said, Ms. Boni attempted to relay phone calls to the plane saying she did not

 approve.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767274 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

"My children," she wrote to Ms. Buchanan, "are not available for publicity stunts."

As Mr. Rendell was boarding the airplane, Ms. McCombs recalled, Mr. Altmire told her "this lady from the adoption

agency is trying to stop our flight and saying we're kidnapping the children."

Ms. McCombs said she called Ms. Boni to tell her that U.S. authorities were backing the mission, but said Ms. Boni did
not believe her.

Shortly before noon the airplane was in the air, heading south.

Ms. Buchanan pleaded with an Allegheny County youth services official to tell her what was going on. She said he

referred her to UPMC's public relations department.

Ms. May, the immigration lawyer, did not figure out until Sunday night that she was working with two separate missions.

"I believed everyone involved was working to get those children out and everyone was genuinely concerned about the
welfare of the children," she said. "It became evident that there was a political dynamic to this that no one had

anticipated."

Ms. Boni, reached last week, called it "unfortunate" that she was kept unaware of the mission that included Mr. Rendell
and Mr. Altmire. But, she said, "regardless of how it was done, it turned out right."

Joanna,

Out of the 12 children listed who are at the Embassy now, we only have ever heard of 2 of them before.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767274 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

The other 10 were not on any previous list of children given to us by BRESMA, nor are they in the database in any way.

BRESMA had given us a complete list of all of its children on January 18, including those that were destined for France.
None of these children match with any of those on the previous list except the two, and those two were not destined for

France.

We have received one e-mail from a prospective parent for one of these children just today, stating clearly that the
match occurred after January 12. I expect we'll get 8 more e-mails just like this one from the others PAPs in the near

term.

The two children we have heard of before were on previous BRESMA lists as "waiting children".

</span>

Caitlin/Nora — although the decision has not been finalized, Gov Rendell has probably figured out that the 12 children
from the Bresma orphanage will not be approved for humanitarian parole. His staff is stating that one of the orphans

slated to go to the U.S. has died "within the last few days." I understand that a child at the Bresma orphanage died
within the last couple of weeks; that child, reportedly, had been matched with a French adoptive family. In any event,

Gov. Rendell is pushing very hard for the USG to permit the children to travel, and dismissing our reasons for not having
done so as "bureaucratic."

Sec. Napolitano's special assistant, Noah Kroloff, has suggested that Secretary Clinton may need to call the Governor. I

sent an update on the issue this morning (at 1015); nothing has changed since. Please let me know what I could provide
right now that would be helpful. M ichele

I just spoke to Gov. Rendell, and he is strongly urging the WH/State Dept. to allow the orphans into the US. He claims
Haitian Government has signed off on it, and US is now standing in the way. He is not open to the argument that we

need to follow protocols, and claims we are being bureaucratic. He says if another orphan dies, it will be on us.

I would suggest that we need a high-level principal who knows the issue to call the Governor and explain the importance

of our process. Probably, at least initially,	                   Sec. Napolitano, Raj Shah at USAID, or Cheryl Mills at	       B5
State. If that does not calm things down, then perhaps a call from Valerie Jarrett or VP.

Governor will be coming to DC on Saturday for NGA. Best if we can resolve this quickly, if possible.

Thoughts?

Bresma

USCIS staff at the Embassy are compiling information about the 12 Bresma children and will report it to USCIS-HQ for
evaluation. The USCIS staff are in contact by email with Ms. McCombs but have not asked her to return to the Embassy

today.

The Prime Minister affirmed to the Ambassador during their meeting this morning that he wants to stick with the
current protocol governing eligibility for adoptee humanitarian parole and will not propose a separate process for the 12

 Bresma children.

                                                                                                                    1.4(B )
                                                                                                                    1.4(D )

                                                                                                                    B1

 We should probably anticipate that if/when the PM makes any public statement about the case (or in any private
 communication with those pressing for approval of the Bresma children's applications),

                                                                                                                       1.4(D )

Rescue bids had political overtones linked to congressional race

Sunday, January 24, 2010

By Dennis B. Roddy, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

The early stages of efforts to rescue 54 Haitian orphans and bring them to Pittsburgh turned into a competition with
political undertones, secret meetings and a possible foretaste of a coming congressional race.

Mary Beth Buchanan, the former U.S. attorney for Western Pennsylvania, opened a bid to extract the children and the

sisters from Ben Avon who ran the BRESMA orphanage in Port-au-Prince.

Ms. Buchanan, who has been openly mulling a run for the Republican nomination to challenge incumbent Rep. Jason

Altmire, D-McCandless, spent four days obtaining clearance for the children to enter the. United States, medical supplies
for the trip down and back, physicians to escort the children and -- in the final link that did not fall into place in time -- an
airplane cleared to land in Haiti.

She said the organizer of the other rescue attempt, Leslie Merrill McCombs, a senior consultant for UPMC [University of
Pittsburg Medical Center], phoned and grilled her for information, obtained a list of the children and ended up shipping

medical supplies gathered as part of the Buchanan effort on the plane that carried Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Mr.
Altmire.

However the successful rescue was organized, it had the effect of short-circuiting Ms. Buchanan's effort and shifting
attention to Mr. Altmire, a former UPMC lobbyist.

 Ms. Buchanan said she started on Thursday, Jan. 14, two days after the quake, by contacting Jonathan Wander, a local
writer who was close with the McMutrie sisters. He put her in touch with Diana Boni, who is in charge of Haiti adoptions
for Kentucky Adoption Services, the company with legal standing to file a petition for asylum on behalf of the children.

 Ms. Buchanan also enlisted Valerie May, a Pittsburgh immigration lawyer. With Ms. Boni, they assembled a three-part
 list: BRESMA children close to final adoption; those with prospective parents but whose adoptions were in the early

stages; and children with no current prospects.

 Ms. Buchanan also placed a call to an old friend: Dr. Mary Carrasco, director of A Child's Place, based at UPMC Mercy

 hospital. Dr. Carrasco, in turn, contacted Kathy McCauley, a grants consultant who had worked for foundations in the
 past. Ms. McCauley's job: assemble lists of medical supplies being gathered for the flight.

 The dining room table of the Buchanan home in Fox Chapel became a makeshift headquarters. Bram Reichbaum, a local
 blogger, assisted as Ms. Buchanan worked a telephone and computer. She needed legal clearance to remove the

 children. She needed an airplane.

 By the end of that day, she said, Joseph Klaus, U.S. Customs port director for Pittsburgh, said his supervisors had given

 the go-ahead to grant humanitarian parole -- permission to enter the country as a refugee -- if the children reached
 Pittsburgh International Airport. By 10:57 a.m. on Friday, Jan. 15, she had an e-mail from Mr. Klaus confirming it.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774141 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

Also that Thursday night, Ms. Buchanan said, she was in Ms. May's law offices Downtown when she returned a call from
Ms. McCombs, a social acquaintance.

"She wanted me to know she was also working to save the orphans and she wanted to find out where I was in the

process," said Ms. Buchanan, adding that she briefed Ms. McCombs.

When she offered Dr. Carrasco's contact information, she said, "I got, 'Well, I don't think I'm going to need that because
this is going to be a UPMC effort.'"

Ms. Buchanan said she was thrown.

"I was frustrated at the belief this was a UPMC effort and they didn't need any others. It was clear to me that her
message was UPMC wanted to handle this and they didn't want the assistance of Dr. Carrasco," she said.

Ms. Buchanan said Ms. McCombs also told her she had talked to the McMutrie family and "the family was going to fire

the adoption agency."

"I tried to explain to her that the adoption agency was the legal guardian," Ms. Buchanan said.

Ms. McCombs, however, said Ms. Buchanan called and grilled her for details.

"She's very aggressively asking me what I'm doing," said Ms. McCombs. "So I told her I'd been working closely with the
governor, who had been making this happen. I gave her some of the details, but not everything."

She also complained that Ms. Buchanan then gave statements to the media about the planned rescue. When next they

spoke, Ms. McCombs said she raised that issue with Ms. Buchanan.

"She was extraordinarily upset with me and very, very rude on the phone. She said UPMC just wants all the credit," Ms.
McCombs said.

As Jamie McMutrie went before a Haitian judge to get clearance for the children to leave the country, Ms. Buchanan's

group was lining up a plane. Officials at United Airlines in Chicago said they could provide a 160-seat airplane, but
 needed clearance to land in Haiti.

 At the same time, lawyers at the May firm put together an application with the U.S. State Department on behalf of Ms.

 Boni and Kentucky Adoption Services, seeking permission to remove the children from Haiti. It included a list of names
 and personal data on the orphans they wanted to bring out.

 Dr. Alan Russell, a surgery professor at the University of Pittsburgh who worked on the other plan, said he concluded

 that Ms. Buchanan's plan would not work while listening to her conversation with the McMurtie family on the night of
 Friday, Jan. 15.

 Dr. Russell said he did not believe Ms. Buchanan had a plane ready to land and that, despite her assurance that she had

 waivers for all the orphans to enter the United States, she had only 28.

 "Listening in to the phone call I made an informed judgment that our team had secured both things and we needed to
 focus to use them. We never competed [with Ms. Buchanan], but we decided to be very careful about what we

 promised and we realized that the situation was so fluid that the 'facts' were changing continuously. We did not have
 time for local politics because the important political dance had to be played out in Port-au-Prince," Dr. Russell said

 later.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774141 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

"I just thought it was more likely that the plan that recognized the complexity of the mission and that could bring a real
congressman [versus someone who was considering running against him] and a real governor was worth working on."

On Saturday, Jan. 16, the May law firm e-mailed a copy of the application and list to Ms. Buchanan. She called the May
office and asked why Ms. McCombs also had received a copy.

"Leslie McCombs had contacted the law firm the day before and told them that she was working with us to help rescue
the orphans," Ms. Buchanan said.

"The McMutrie family had asked me to contact May Law Group," Ms. McCombs responded.

Ms. Buchanan assembled her grdup on Sunday afternoon in a meeting room at Buchanan Ingersoll, her husband's law
firm. Present, she said, were Dr. Carrasco, Chad McMutrie, a brother of the two sisters, and members of the medical
team being put together by Dr. Carrasco.

During the meeting, United Airlines called Ms. Buchanan to say it could not get in the air the next day, but would try for
Tuesday. Ms. Buchanan said she went home.

"[Dr.] Carrasco called me and said she had been invited to another meeting that was being held by Leslie McCombs. She
said she didn't know the purpose of the meeting," she said.

Ms. Buchanan said she also spoke with Ms. Boni that night.

"She had heard a rumor there was another group trying to get a flight out of Pittsburgh on Monday into Haiti and she
asked me who Leslie McCombs was."

That night, Ms. McCombs presided at a meeting at the China Palace Restaurant in McCandless. Others who attended
included Mr. Altmire and officials from UPMC, Allegheny County human services officials, Catholic Charities, as well as

Dr. Carrasco.

Ms. Buchanan was not among those invited. The e-mail calling the meeting made it clear: the UPMC team had a plane.

The meeting ended with instructions to keep things quiet, leak nothing to the media, and be at the airport the next
morning.

 Early Monday morning, Ms. Buchanan received phone calls from reporters: A plane was getting ready to leave
 Pittsburgh International.

 From South Dakota, Ms. Boni e-mailed Ms. Buchanan, seemingly furious.that Ms. McCombs and her group were about
to go to Haiti. Later, Ms. Buchanan said, Ms. Boni attempted to relay phone calls to the plane saying she did not
approve.

"My children," she wrote to Ms. Buchanan, "are not available for publicity stunts."

 As Mr. Rendell was boarding the airplane, Ms. McCombs recalled, Mr. Altmire told her "this lady from the adoption
 agency is trying to stop our flight and saying we're kidnapping the children."

 Ms. McCombs said she called Ms. Boni to tell her that U.S. authorities were backing the mission, but said Ms. Boni did
 not believe her.

 Shortly before noon the airplane was in the air, heading south.

 Ms. Buchanan pleaded with an Allegheny County youth services official to tell her what was going on. She said he
 referred her to UPMC's public relations department.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. CO5774141 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

Ms. May, the immigration lawyer, did not figure out until Sunday night that she was working with two separate missions.

"I believed everyone involved was working to get those children out and everyone was genuinely concerned about the
welfare of the children," she said. "It became evident that there was a political dynaMic to this that no one had
anticipated."

Ms. Boni, reached last week, called it "unfortunate" that she was kept unaware of the mission that included Mr. Rendell

and Mr. Altmire. But, she said, "regardless of how it was done, it turned out right."

 Joanna,

 Out of the 12 children listed who are at the Embassy now, we only have ever heard of 2 of them before.

 The other 10 were not on any previous list of children given to us by BRESMA, nor are they in the database in any way.
 BRESMA had given us a complete list of all of its children on January 18, including those that were destined for France.

 None of these children match with any of those on the previous list except the two, and those two were not destined for
 France.

 We have received one e-mail from a prospective parent for one of these children just today, stating clearly that the

 match occurred after January 12. I expect we'll get 8 more e-mails just like this one from the others PAPs in the near
 term .

Adding Brian and Evan from VP's office, and Cecilia and Straut in IGA.

I just spoke to Gov. Rendell, and he is strongly urging the WH/State Dept. to allow the orphans into the US. He claims
Haitian Government has signed off on it, and US is now standing in the way. He is not open to the argument that we

need to follow protocols, and claims we are being bureaucratic. He says if another orphan dies, it will be on us.

 I would suggest that we need a high-level principal who knows the issue to call the Governor and explain the importance
of our process. Probably, at least initially,                      , Sec. Napolitano, Raj Shah at USAID, or Cheryl Mills at	        B5
State. If that does not calm things down, then perhaps a call from Valerie Jarrett or VP.

 Governor will be coming to DC on Saturday for NGA. Best if we can resolve this quickly, if possible.

 Bresma

USCIS staff at the Embassy are compiling information about the 12 Bresma children and will report it to USCIS-HQ for
evaluation. The USCIS staff are in contact by email with Ms. McCombs but have not asked her to return to the Embassy
today.

The Prime Minister affirmed to the Ambassador during their meeting this morning that he wants to stick with the
current protocol governing eligibility for adoptee humanitarian parole and will not propose a separate process for the 12

Bresma children.
                                                                                                                       1.4(B)

                                                                                                                       1.4(D )

We should probably anticipate that if/when the PM makes any public statement about the case (or in any private
communication with those pressing for approval of the Bresma children's applications),

                                                                                                                          1.4(D )

Rescue bids had political overtones linked to congressional race

Sunday, January 24, 2010

 By Dennis B. Roddy, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

The early stages of efforts to rescue 54 Haitian orphans and bring them to Pittsburgh turned into a competition with

 political undertones, secret meetings and a possible foretaste of a coming congressional race.

 Mary Beth Buchanan, the former U.S. attorney for Western Pennsylvania, opened a bid to extract the children and the

 sisters from Ben Avon who ran the BRESMA orphanage in Port-au-Prince.

 Ms. Buchanan, who has been openly mulling a run for the Republican nomination to challenge incumbent Rep. Jason

 Altmire, D-McCandless, spent four days obtaining clearance for the children to enter the United States, medical supplies
 for the trip down and back, physicians to escort the children and -- in the final link that did not fall into place in time -- an

 airplane cleared to land in Haiti.

 She said the organizer of the other rescue attempt, Leslie Merrill McCombs, a senior consultant for UPMC [University of

 Pittsburg Medical Center], phoned and grilled her for information, obtained a list of the children and ended up shipping
 medical supplies gathered as part of the Buchanan effort on the plane that carried Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Mr.
 Altmire.

 However the successful rescue was organized, it had the effect of short-circuiting Ms. Buchanan's effort and shifting
 attention to Mr. Altmire, a former UPMC lobbyist.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774143 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

Ms. Buchanan said she started on Thursday, Jan. 14, two days after the quake, by contacting Jonathan Wander, a local

writer who was close with the McMutrie sisters. He put her in touch with Diana Boni, who is in charge of Haiti adoptions
for Kentucky Adoption Services, the company with legal standing to file a petition for asylum on behalf of the children.

Ms. Buchanan also enlisted Valerie May, a Pittsburgh immigration lawyer. With Ms. Boni, they assembled a three-part

list: BRESMA children close to final adoption; those with prospective parents but whose adoptions were in the early
stages; and children with no current prospects.

Ms. Buchanan also placed a call to an old friend: Dr. Mary Carrasco, director of A Child's Place, based at UPMC Mercy

hospital. Dr. Carrasco, in turn, contacted Kathy McCauley, a grants consultant who had worked for foundations in the
past. Ms. McCauley's job: assemble lists of medical supplies being gathered for the flight.

The dining room table of the Buchanan home in Fox Chapel became a makeshift headquarters. Bram Reichbaum, a local
blogger, assisted as Ms. Buchanan worked a telephone and computer. She needed legal clearance to remove the

children. She needed an airplane.

By the end of that day, she said, Joseph Klaus, U.S. Customs port director for Pittsburgh, said his supervisors had given

the go-ahead to grant humanitarian parole -- permission to enter the country as a refugee -- if the children reached
Pittsburgh International Airport. By 10:57 a.m. on Friday, Jan. 15, she had an e-mail from Mr. Klaus confirming it.

Also that Thursday night, Ms. Buchanan said, she was in Ms. May's law offices Downtown when she returned a call from

Ms. McCombs, a social acquaintance.

"She wanted me to know she was also working to save the orphans and she wanted to find out where I was in the
process," said Ms. Buchanan, adding that she briefed Ms. McCombs.

When she offered Dr. Carrasco's contact information, she said, "I got, 'Well, I don't think I'm going to need that because

this is going to be a UPMC effort.'"

Ms. Buchanan said she was thrown.

"I was frustrated at the belief this was a UPMC effort and they didn't need any others. It was clear to me that her
message was UPMC wanted to handle this and they didn't want the assistance of Dr. Carrasco," she said.

 Ms. Buchanan said Ms. McCombs also told her she had talked to the McMutrie family and "the family was going to fire

the adoption agency."

"I tried to explain to her that the adoption agency was the legal guardian," Ms. Buchanan said.

 Ms. McCombs, however, said Ms. Buchanan called and grilled her for details.

"She's very aggressively asking me what I'm doing," said Ms. McCombs. "So I told her I'd been working closely with the
governor, who had been making this happen. I gave her some of the details, but not everything."

She also complained that Ms. Buchanan then gave statements to the media about the planned rescue. When next they

 spoke, Ms. McCombs said she raised that issue with Ms. Buchanan.

 "She was extraordinarily upset with me and very, very rude on the phone. She said UPMC just wants all the credit," Ms.
 McCombs said.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774143 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

As Jamie McMutrie went before a Haitian judge to get clearance for the children to leave the country, Ms. Buchanan's

group was lining up a plane. Officials at United Airlines in Chicago said they could provide a 160-seat airplane, but
needed clearance to land in Haiti.

At the same time, lawyers at the May firm put together an application with the U.S. State Department on behalf of Ms.

Boni and Kentucky Adoption Services, seeking permission to remove the children from Haiti. It included a list of names
and personal data on the orphans they wanted to bring out.

Dr. Alan Russell, a surgery professor at the University of Pittsburgh who worked on the other plan, said he concluded

that Ms. Buchanan's plan would not work while listening to her conversation with the McMurtie family on the night of
Friday, Jan. 15.

Dr. Russell said he did not believe Ms. Buchanan had a plane ready to land and that, despite her assurance that she had
waivers for all the orphans to enter the United States, she had only 28.

"Listening in to the phone call I made an informed judgment that our team had secured both things and we needed to

focus to use them. We never competed [with Ms. Buchanan], but we decided to be very careful about what we
promised and we realized that the situation was so fluid that the 'facts' were changing continuously. We did not have

time for local politics because the important political dance had to be played out in Port-au-Prince," Dr. Russell said
later.

"I just thought it was more likely that the plan that recognized the complexity of the mission and that could bring a real

congressman [versus someone who was considering running against him] and a real governor was worth working on."

On Saturday, Jan. 16, the May law firm e-mailed a copy of the application and list to Ms. Buchanan. She called the May
office and asked why Ms. McCombs also had received a copy.

"Leslie McCombs had contacted the law firm the day before and told them that she was working with us to help rescue

the orphans," Ms. Buchanan said.

"The McMutrie family had asked me to contact May Law Group," Ms. McCombs responded.

Ms. Buchanan assembled her group on Sunday afternoon in a meeting room at Buchanan Ingersoll, her husband's law
firm. Present, she said, were Dr. Carrasco, Chad McMutrie, a brother of the two sisters, and members of the medical

team being put together by Dr. Carrasco.

During the meeting, United Airlines called Ms. Buchanan to say it could not get in the air the next day, but would try for
Tuesday. Ms. Buchanan said she went home.

"[Dr.] Carrasco called me and said she had been invited to another meeting that was being held by Leslie McCombs. She

said she didn't know the purpose of the meeting," she said.

 Ms. Buchanan said she also spoke with Ms. Boni that night.

 "She had heard a rumor there was another group trying to get a flight out of Pittsburgh on Monday into Haiti and she
 asked me who Leslie McCombs was."

 That night, Ms. McCombs presided at a meeting at the China Palace Restaurant in McCandless. Others who attended

 included Mr. Altmire and officials from UPMC, Allegheny County human services officials, Catholic Charities, as well as
 Dr. Carrasco.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774143 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

Ms. Buchanan was not among those invited. The e-mail calling the meeting made it clear: the UPMC team had a plane.
The meeting ended with instructions to keep things quiet, leak nothing to the media, and be at the airport the next
morning.

Early Monday morning, Ms. Buchanan received phone calls from reporters: A plane was getting ready to leave
Pittsburgh International.

From South Dakota, Ms. Boni e-mailed Ms. Buchanan, seemingly furious that Ms. McCombs and her group were about

to go to Haiti. Later, Ms. Buchanan said, Ms. Boni attempted to relay phone calls to the plane saying she did not
approve.

"My children," she wrote to Ms. Buchanan, "are not available for publicity stunts."

As Mr. Rendell was boarding the airplane, Ms. McCombs recalled, Mr. Altmire told her "this lady from the adoption

agency is trying to stop our flight and saying we're kidnapping the children."

Ms. McCombs said she called Ms. Boni to tell her that U.S. authorities were backing the mission, but said Ms. Boni did

not believe her.

Shortly before noon the airplane was in the air, heading south.

Ms. Buchanan pleaded with an Allegheny County youth services official to tell her what was going on. She said he

referred her to UPMC's public relations department.

Ms. May, the immigration lawyer, did not figure out until Sunday night that she was working with two separate missions.

"I believed everyone involved was working to get those children out and everyone was genuinely concerned about the
welfare of the children," she said. "It became evident that there was a political dynamic to this that no one had

anticipated."

 Ms. Boni, reached last week, called it "unfortunate" that she was kept unaware of the mission that included Mr. Rendell

and Mr. Altmire. But, she said, "regardless of how it was done, it turned out right."

Although the Governor's office believes all of these children were "in the adoption pipeline" before the earthquake, now

that we have their names and USCIS has been able to run a preliminary check about them, they have found information
on only two of the orphans. Although it is preliminary, the following information raises some questions.

Joanna,

Out of the 12 children listed who are at the Embassy now, we only have ever heard of 2 of them before.

The other 10 were not on any previous list of children given to us by BRESMA, nor are they in the database in any way.

BRESMA had given us a complete list of all of its children on January 18, including those that were destined for France.
None of these children match with any of those on the previous list except the two, and those two were not destined for

France.

We have received one e-mail from a prospective parent for one of these children just today, stating clearly that the
match occurred after January 12. I expect we'll get 8 more e-mails just like this one from the others PAPs in the near

term.

The two children we have heard of before were on previous BRESMA lists as "waiting children".

   Re: Q's attacks post-UN resolution: Sail's strategy; Mousa Kousa's fears

   Note:

                                                                      With that in mind, here is the latest report:

   During the evening of March 18, 2011senior advisors to Saif al Qaddafi stated in confidence that the passage of
   the UN resolution authorizing force against Libya's forces came as a surprise to IVIuammar Qaddafi, who had
   believed that the governments of Russia and China would block such a move. Qaddafi continues to believe that

   there will be a delay before the beginning of any allied attacks on his forces, and he has sent intermediaries to
   rulers of Yemen and Syria to attempt to ensure that they will block any effort by the Arab League to participate
   in these attacks. He has received no answer to these requests. (Source Comment: Qaddafi believes that while
   the Arab League has passed a resolution supporting a no-fly zone over Libya, the member states will not
                                                                                                                    .
   actually participate in this type of operation. In this regard he is focused on current statements by officials of
   the United States that Arab League states must participate in any military activity.)

   According to these individuals Qaddafi is furious with the governments of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Great Britain,
   and France, whom he sees as his principal enemies in this matter. Qaddafi is holding out hope that the United
   States and Germany will not play direct roles in any action. Saif Qaddafi told advisors in confidence that he
   expects the French Air Force, supported by the British Air Force, to attack Libyan airfields and artillery parks in

   the near.future, adding that French President Nicolas Sarkozy wants to destroy the Qaddafi regime before they
   draw additional attention to financial aid provided to his 2007 presidential campaign. Saif is encouraging his
   father to press the attack on Benghazi in an effort to end the rebellion before these attacks can take place. Saif

   also believes that propaganda is the only effective weapon Libya has against such attacks.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05779786 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

(Source Comment: According to knowledgeable individuals Foreign Minister Mousa Kousa was also surprised

by the UN vote, and is now concerned that Qaddafi does not grasp the serious nature of the situation. He
believes this vote will improve the level of confidence among the rebels, while the first allied air attacks may
destroy the discipline and morale in the Libyan Army (particularly their African and Algerian Taureg
mercenaries), once they realize that there is little effective defense against these sophisticated forces. That said,
Mousa Kousa is committed to Qaddafi and continues to believe that the differences among the Western Allies,

and a lack of organization on the part of the rebel leadership gives the Libyan leader a chance for victory, if the
army can move quickly toward Benghazi. His hope is that aggressive attacks will panic the rebel forces in
Benghazi, and that they will abandon the city. Under this threat, Mousa Kousa also believes that some of the
tribal groups who have been working with the rebels may turn back to Qaddafi.)

During the afternoon and early evening of March 18 the Libyan Air Force launched air raids against the rebel
held region of Misrata, while the army, using its heavy 155 mm motorized guns, bombarded the town. Libyan
commanders reported to their headquarters in Tripoli that the town was burning, but rebel forces were
continuing to resist the Army's advance. At the same time, intelligence officials have informed Saif Qaddafi
that members of two of the Benghazi region's main tribes, the Tarhuna and Warfalla, expressed support for
Qaddafi. They also received word that some members of these tribes had skirmished with rebel forces in the

suburbs of Benghazi.

(Source Comment: There was no information on the results of these skirmishes. In addition, knowledgeable
sources report that over the past week Qaddafi's forces have moved west after retaking the village of Bisher and
the town of Uqayla, 12 miles fromBrega. These source indicated that a limited number of rebel military units
have switched back to Qaddafi's command. The tribal forces are watching the situation and could also change

loyalty to Qaddafi if they believe the rebels are lost. Accordingly, the UN resolution authorizing force against
Qaddafi is an important psychological victory for the rebels. The greatest challenge for the rebels continues to
be the organization of a command and control structure that can pursue the fight against Qaddafi, while training
the new recruits to the rebel cause. The greatest challenges for Qaddifi's forces are their extended supply lines,
and fear of the impending allied attacks. Rebel commanders do not believe that Qaddafi's forces are in a
position to attack the large city of Benghazi directly; however, they are concerned that if the Libyan Army does

capture the city they will seek vengeance against the civilian population.)

During the evening of March 18, 2011senior advisors to Saif at Qaddafi stated in confidence that the passage of

the UN resolution authorizing force against Libya's forces came as a surprise to Muammar Qaddafi, who had
believed that the governments of Russia and China would block such a move. Qaddafi continues to believe that
there will be a delay before the beginning of any allied attacks on his forces, and he has sent intermediaries to
rulers of Yemen and Syria to attempt to ensure that they will block any effort by the Arab League to participate

in these attacks. He has received no answer to these requests. (Source Comment: Qaddafi believes that while
the Arab League has passed a resolution supporting a no-fly zone over Libya, the member states will not
actually participate in this type of operation. In this regard he is focused on current statements by officials of

the United States that Arab League states must participate in any military activity.)

According to these individuals Qaddafi is furious with the governments of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Great Britain,

and France, whom he sees as his principal enemies in this matter. Qaddafi is holding out hope that the United
States and Germany will not play direct roles in any action. Saif Qaddafi told advisors in confidence that he

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05787341 Date: 02/29/2016</span>

expects the French Air Force, supported by the British Air Force, to attack Libyan airfields and artillery parks in

the near future, adding that French President Nicolas Sarkozy wants to destroy the Qaddafi regime before they
draw additional attention to financial aid provided to his 2007 presidential campaign. Saif is encouraging his
father to press the attack on Benghazi in an effort to end the rebellion before these attacks can take place. Saif
also believes that propaganda is the only effective weapon Libya has against such attacks.

(Source Comment: According to knowledgeable individuals Foreign Minister Mousa Kousa was also surprised
by the UN vote, and is now concerned that Qaddafi does not grasp the serious nature of the situation. He
believes this vote will improve the level of confidence among the rebels, while the first allied air attacks may
destroy the discipline and morale in the Libyan Army (particularly their African and Algerian Taureg
mercenaries), once they realize that there is little effective defense against these sophisticated forces. That said,
Mousa Kousa is committed to Qaddafi and continues to believe that the differences among the Western Allies,

and a lack of organization on the part of the rebel leadership gives the Libyan leader a chance for victory, if the
army can move quickly toward Benghazi. His hope is that aggressive attacks will panic the rebel forces in
Benghazi, and that they will abandon the city. Under this threat, Mousa Kousa also believes that some of the
tribal groups who have been working with the rebels may turn back to Qaddafi.)

During the afternoon and early evening of March 18 the Libyan Air Force launched air raids against the rebel

held region of Misrata, while the army, using its heavy 155 mm motorized guns, bombarded the town. Libyan
commanders reported to their headquarters in Tripoli that the town was burning, but rebel forces were
continuing to resist the Army's advance. At the same time, intelligence officials have informed Saif Qaddafi
that members of two of the Benghazi region's main tribes, the Tarhuna and Warfalla, expressed support for
Qaddafi. They also received word that some members of these tribes had skirmished with rebel forces in the
suburbs of Benghazi.

(Source Comment: There was no information on the results of these skirmishes. In addition, knowledgeable
sources report that over the past week Qaddafi's forces have moved west after retaking the village of Bisher and
the town of Uqayla, 12 miles fromBrega. These source indicated that a limited number of rebel military units
have switched back to Qaddafi's command. The tribal forces are watching the situation and could also change
loyalty to Qaddafi if they believe the rebels are lost. Accordingly, the UN resolution authorizing force against
Qaddafi is an important psychological victory for the rebels. The greatest challenge for the rebels continues to

be the organization of a command and control structure that can pursue the fight against Qaddafi, while training
the new recruits to the rebel cause. The greatest challenges for Qaddifi's forces are their extended supply lines,
and fear of the impending allied attacks. Rebel commanders do not believe that Qaddafi's forces are in a
position to attack the large city of Benghazi directly; however, they are concerned that if the Libyan Army does
capture the city they will seek vengeance against the civilian population.)

The Political Scene

The Empty Chamber

Just how broken is the Senate?

Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration....
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate....

Cit and watch us for seven days," one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. "You know what you'll see happening?
Nothing."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

'This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'"

Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.
"It's unconscionable," Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. "The obstructionism has become
mindless."
The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly
behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and
top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.

"Also, it's a dumb rule in itself," McCaskill said. "It's time we started looking at some of these rules."
She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and
subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had
scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general
and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and McCaskill's
Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training of Afghan

police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a victory
ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-care
reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most embarrassing
sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who had fought the
bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.
So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard
Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. "I have no personal objection to

continuing," Burr said. But, he added, "there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object."
Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In
general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be
present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their first
look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The
presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce them to
the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about the

Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, "Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the
floor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they're
doing in China right now?"
Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name every
few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the press
lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of interest
actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers. On this

afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the transcription
machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate chamber is an
intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.
Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to
hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some
built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority

and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,
"Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and not
be distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule."
The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon; the
general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators these
days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-term
successes while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.
Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three

amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an
amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch the
amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was to
finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the only
 thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty
minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to

 yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,
 would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.
Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, "This is the first time in recent memory
 that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to kill the
 reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are defeated."
 Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. "The position on the other side
 of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good," he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose

 half an octave. "Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an
inconvenience."
The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded

Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to
emphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides the
chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third
person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the
moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's "Manual of
Parliamentary Practice"—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from insulting

any senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting at Al
Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: "Mr. President, make no mistake, the intent
of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform. . . . A senator on
the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill health-care
reform!"
The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: "The time of the senator has expired."

For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that happens
on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the Democrats
while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that it wouldn't
have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had been designed to
make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically supports. One
amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on individuals making less

than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and outlandish. David Vitter, a
Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican
obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with mental illness would not be
denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent "convicted child molesters, rapists, and sex offenders" from
buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was allotted to explain his Viagra
amendment without cracking a smile. "This is not a game amendment," he insisted. "It actually saves money."

So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.
"The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate," Baucus declared. "It is a crass
political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy." Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a
clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. "Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins." Thirty-five-second pause. "Mr. Conrad, Mr.
Corker." Ten seconds. "Mr. Cornyn." Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they're
so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues
milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John McCain—

now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed, trying to catch
the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben Nelson, of
Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.
The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled drone
was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, "Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!" Sporadically, a
sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could charm into
laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo animals—Levin a

 shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one displayed a limited set of
 behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and clamped his hands down on a
 colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which senators were loners (Russ
 Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which senators were important (Dick
 Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).
 Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through

 her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. "Can we
 get some order?" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It
 was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.
 Harry Reid controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.
 Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous
 negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,
 unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was

 hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the chamber
 to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow, of Michigan,
 her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion momentarily
 eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face, as if casting
 her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, "The longest it lasted was thirty seconds."
 At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just found

 two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the bill would
 go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the Capitol's

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty streets.

On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if waiting for
someone to take him away.
The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the
Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. "Everyone's
tired," Reid declared before the final vote. "This legislative fight is one for the record books." He was so fatigued that he
initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. "Way to go, Lindsey, way to

stretch it out," Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the losing
team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a moment the
chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.
The Senate is often referred to as "the world's greatest deliberative body." Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from
Oregon, said, "That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of
exchange of ideas, is so limited." Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a

Republican and a Democrat. "The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation occurring in
which they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber."
Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.
"You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue," he said.
Instead, a senator typically gives "a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets
up and gives a speech on a completely different subject." From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a

colloquy—"I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantage
plan"—that has been scripted in advance by aides.
While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits
from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.
Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same
morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a hearing
can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an unwritten

rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows senators to spend
four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their families in their
home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless fund-raising, and
to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House, in 1995, he
told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader, said,
"When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one hundred senators there
was Wednesday afternoon."

Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, "Of any free time
you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more," is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own
campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on
behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate
office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee
Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, "It sucks up time that a
senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues."

In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took time
to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a million
dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry groups
were spending $1.4 million a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-raising
and lobbying, said, "People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The over-all bills
are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money."

Deschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: "Sometimes, you're dialling for dollars,
you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the floor, your
staff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double check—but,
just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye vote, or a no
vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up sometimes. But, if
you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope nobody asks, because
I don't have a clue."

Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past few
 decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff members,
 who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional relationships, tend to
 push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—writing bills, negotiating
 the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox' or MSNBC.
 One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. "You know about all
 these rags that cover the Hill, right?" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, Con gressDaily,

 and CQ  Today—all   of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of
 the "24/7 media," provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a "dust-up" between Scott

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South Carolina;
the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront DeMint on the

Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators have a young
press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of political
obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go unreported
because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to the Senate in
1981 and will leave next January, told me, "I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who covered me on a
daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications only see me

through the prism of conflict." Lamar Alexander described the effect as "this instant radicalizing of positions to the left and
the right."
Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly
fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan coOperation is still
permissible. "A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution," Gregg said. "Substantive,
thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside."

Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus lunch
to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one
another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses
who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill
Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall has
set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the

seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: "In those days Democrats and
Republicans actually enjoyed each other's company.") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim
DeMint, Dodd said, "Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well." He repeated something that Jon
Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: "There's no trust." Dodd, whose father was a senator,
went on, "That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with that
conclusion. And if that's missing.

There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party as
"friends." Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as "one of my best friends in the Senate," and
both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with
Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining. Udall
noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But opportunities to
bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the "inner sanctum," where
Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the seventies, old bulls

such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did. "You
learned, and also you found out what was going on," Dodd said, adding, "It's awfully difficult to say crappy things about
someone that you just had lunch with." These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty. Senators eat lunch in their
respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else "downtown," which means asking donors for money over
steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the "caucus lunch" was instituted by Republicans in
the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980, followed suit. Caucus lunches work
members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry

Reid as an idiot. "At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors," Alexander joked, adding, "We spend most of
our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other."
In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. "They kind of dwindled off during the
health-care debate," Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few
months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,
joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.
These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers

 who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson, of
Wisconsin, put it this way: "Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?"
 The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.
 The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.
 For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a
 levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply

 impressed by the quality of its members: "They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous instincts
 animating it, not the petty passions." But he also recognized that "a minority of the nation dominating the Senate could
 completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the spirit of
 constitutional government." As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented statesmen,
 Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.
 Robert A. Caro, in "Master of the Senate," the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War •

 the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster, Henry
 Clay, and John  C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the Presidencies of
 Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of Southern racists

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

and Republican corporate shills, and was "the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed themselves in vain—
the chief obstructive force in the federal government." By the fifties, the Senate had become far more conservative than
the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book "Citadel," called the Senate "to a most peculiar
degree, a Southern   Institution . . . growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly" and "the only place in the

country where the South did not lose the war."
By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise and
Consent," based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and
Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works, in
its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one
another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-raisers,

no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.
In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's "famous 'club' atmosphere is
based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand. . . . They thrust hard
at one another in debate over serious matters," but, he writes, "understanding and accommodation in the ordinary course
of the Senate day was essential to sanity." Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the Senate to his

will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either "whales"—the heavyweight chairmen who
negotiated legislation—or "minnows," the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when, in 1958, a
formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy, and Philip
Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of "The Fall of the House of
Roosevelt," worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. "They used to talk to each other—that's my most
vivid recollection," he said. "If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners would come in to
hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a deliberative body,

drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically." Senators who ran for office in order to work on foreign policy, social
welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. "But if you wanted to do something there was a mechanism
by which you could do it," Janeway said.
In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and
moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of
those decades as "a bipartisan liberal institution." The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the

Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,
campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed
jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was passed,
in 1965, it won 70-24.
The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church,
Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan "field
hearings" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole's indispensable support,

greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's
legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and
said, "You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That's
how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly." Humphrey's career advice: "You should become Mr. Housing.
Housing is the future."
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and

accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. "The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of
 people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs," Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled. "They
 were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to
Republicans in the Senate today." Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,
 who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, "It was a huge loss of the most experienced,
 accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there
 less than six years." He added, "The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets

 worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others
 didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'"
 After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals
 began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. "So Damn Much Money," a recent book by the Washington      Post
 reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans
 began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan

 coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own
 fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members
 of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to
 regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in
 the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and
 escalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats
 filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-

 called "nuclear option." Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went to

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years
earlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.
The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,

independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that every
election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The Senate,
no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main action was
between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican Senate
majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.
Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly

become populated by "ideologues and charlatans." He went on, "When we do get good people who come in, they very
quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay
there." He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year
working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with
angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about "pulling the plug on
Grandma." Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin "altering his behavior and abandoning

every issue, including campaign-finance reform."
One morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.
A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the
111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger
down the list of senators. He did it again. "I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this." He
was stumped. "Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time." He

put the directory aside. "I'm just having the damnedest time."
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was hired
last year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to
JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm's chairman, until
President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with

which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became lobbyists.
In 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned and formed
a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a two-year
waiting period between serving and lobbying.
When you spend your days at the Senate, it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems
miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute

thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says "Men's Gallery"), and
the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where
senators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over
 the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.
Riddick, called "Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices," which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was
 known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding

 officer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.
 After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's "Advise and Consent" is still faintly visible. "The Senate, by its
 nature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount," Lamar Alexander said. "And that's
 not changed." Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its
 members to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, "To have a chamber
 that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please."

 In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one
 (counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia; liberals,
 like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of
 Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of
 senior senators. "If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific," Chris Dodd said. "My worry is they won't stay. Because it's not
 productive."
 The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in 6 dynamic new era. Instead, their

 young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and "secret holds"—when a senator
 anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire
 McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds, and
 Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical gamesmanship
 between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first year. Michael
 Bennet said, "We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small ones, and where

 things have been put off for a really long period of time." He mentioned the national debt, energy policy, and the financial
 crisis. "Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with bottled

water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was moving.
Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already has to
defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to grow too
attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard. about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: "And then some
more veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.' As the fifteen
months or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems."

Earlier this year, the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th,
Con gressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy
Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his•state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office
maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent several
days and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of unemployed
Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, "Tough shit." (Eventually, Republicans persuaded

Bunning to stop.)
These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,
Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In
2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more
senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called "rolling holds"—and their party leader facilitates the game by
keeping their names secret.
Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of

partisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed
time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-
authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used rule
that allowed the "previous question" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by the
eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and talking
until their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word "filibuster' comes fromvrijbuiter—old Dutch for "looter.")

In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,
which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a "cloture" vote. For decades, the rule was rarely
used; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies and
eighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower the
threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a year, as
both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the Republicans lost
their majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture votes in 2007 and

2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. "Why?" Steny Hoyer, the outraged
Democratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. "Because they do not do their business in a way that facilitates
noncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate." Last week, six House
Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,

haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to run
the General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection was
substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's "Senate Procedure" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and vote.
Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading aloud
of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist; Senate

clerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in frustration.
Under McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative
maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first
 proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues "nihilists," who want to create chaos because it
serves their ideology. "If there's chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions," Harkin said. "In chaos people don't listen
 to reason." McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican strategy
                                                                             "To the extent that they"—the Democrats—
 reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times,
"want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be helpful. To the
 extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful."
 One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after vote.
 Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana; Susan
 Collins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus? Alexander
 said that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, "When you have your back against the wall and the gallows

 are hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: "He said

if we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant." Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster a
military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad
Cochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that
he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with
the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose cloture,

and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)
Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus
bill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-care-
reform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against the
version that went before the full Senate. "I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance Committee
version—it grew by a thousand pages," Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White House officials

that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices, and said that the Democrats "did not
accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch." McConnell was able to exploit her
alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: "She actually said to me once that she had never felt
the pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to her or quite as real or
troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this together. You're a senior
Republican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and you're going to do it.' "

Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the senator
who helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn't give him the leverage
of McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.
In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per cent
of the country's population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a few new
senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.

Tom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent
time in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior
Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,
in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.
"I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas," he said. "Then to be on the inside—the thing
that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show."

In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.
Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend
them, making it extremely difficult. ("Rule XXII is a Catch-22," Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different
idea—the "constitutional option." Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that "each House may determine the Rules
of its Proceedings" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January and
propose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority. There's
even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three times,

most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.
At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings
on the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized working
groups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee chairs by
caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were competing

for the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other for Majority
Leader.)
For Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. "If you want a
 parliamentary form of government, go over to the House," Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. "Why even run for the
 Senate?" Udall's plan for next January, he said, would be a "gigantic mistake."
"They'll get over it," Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. "And they'll get over it quicker if they're
 in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider whatever they

 have to say." He added that the Senate "may be getting done about as much as the American people want done." The
 President's ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of the Republicans I
 spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is "broken." Alexander claimed that he and other Republicans were
 exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate. "The Senate wasn't
 created to be efficient," he argued. "It was created to be inefficient." At one of the filibuster hearings, in April, Alexander,
 sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the Republicans with obstructing
 legislation, "we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our right to debate, our right to offer

 amendments, which is the essence of the Senate."

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah Binder,
a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the filibuster, and

so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. "I would oppose that," Chris Dodd said, adding of the freshmen,
"These are people who have never been in the minority." For older Democrats, who have put in their years, grown adept
at working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat. (Among senior senators,
the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being divided not between
whales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too accustomed to the Senate's
ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate Republicans are too weak to challenge the

newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.
Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic,
wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,
who have created a culture where Tocqueville's "lofty thoughts" and "generous impulses" have no place.
A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial

regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout
Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and
evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to
pass a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.
The affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first

term, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of
Virginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having to
do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They worked
through the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were members of
a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke, Alan

Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still
talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate's "Odd Couple." By February, they had finished
their work.
Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,
dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the
committee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed
McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. "It was an odd place to be," Corker recalled. "And yet that night we

began meeting." The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In
response, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their lobbyists
that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other Republicans of the
Party's line on financial reform.)
On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, "You've been a great
partner." He was ending their talks after only a month. "It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest," Corker told reporters
afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the

rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks
under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other
Republicans with him. "Baloney," Corker said. "If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we'd've had at least twenty-
five Republican votes."
The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike,
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar fund,

paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of another crisis.
But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was now parroting
talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a "partisan bill" that "will guarantee
perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks." McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-one Republicans,
suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded

with his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, "Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the rhetoric.
 Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do. . . . We were supposed to be
 the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat down with cooler
 heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot do that on
 financial regulation, an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it . . ." Corker didn't allow the
 thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.
 Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: "I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced

 with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I am
 not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue . . . then why

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

are we even here?" He went on, "We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is looking out
for their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority seems intent
on proving them right. . . . I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know there are friends

of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate, who want to be part of
the solution."
In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted, "I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four or
five months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it. . . . I have

to say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!"
Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. "You and I went a long
way," Corker told Dodd. "Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats
on your committee."
"And I was not gaining Republicans," Dodd replied.
"You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did

not leave the table." Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few
days.
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-
reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists
prowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the ornate
Reception Room with Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of furniture

scraping across a tile floor. "Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room," Manley said. "Very little happens around
here without a deadline." The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A few weeks
later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform finally came to a
vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He had even voted for
an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have scrapped Corker's work
of many months with Warner.
"The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained

office, under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. "It's the Senate, I guess." McConnell's strategy of obstruction
had once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a "shrinking number" of Republicans were
frustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, "God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking
member on this." Collins responded, "We could have had such a great time on this bill."
Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because "the American people don't trust either political party enough
to give them a blank check," was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. "There was zero
substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes," he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the

bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, "If you want to vote against something, you
can always find your reasons."
But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating
himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of thirty
minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. "I am obviously disappointed," he said. "I think I have spent as
much time as any senator. . . on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good things in

it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not enough time
was spent on some of the core issues."
As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of "So Damn Much Money," in the press gallery. I later
asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of the
Senate. "If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away money
and interest groups," he said. "But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things
 considered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here

 you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet."
After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,
 smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, "For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it
 didn't work." He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with "some Nevadans."
 Durbin said, "I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take
 to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?"

 Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, "I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its
 business much as our founders intended. We did that."
 On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial
 regulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They
 depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,
 and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,

 Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the year.
 And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign finance,
 transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial appointments on

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you can feel the Senate
slipping back into stagnant waters.

Joining the conversation
BY KATE HEARTFIELD, THE OTTAWA CITIZENAUGUST 19, 2010

Ottawa Citizen

The U.S. Department of State has made it very clear: The security of information on BlackBerrys is not just about
economics.

It's also, in the words of spokesman P. J. Crowley, "about what we think is an important element of democracy,

human rights and freedom of information ... You should be opening up societies to these new technologies that have
the opportunity to empower people ..."

Canada's government has made, at least in public, no such link between BlackBerrys and democratization. It has

not spoken about the potential for authoritarian governments to abuse monitoring privileges. It has decided the

demands placed on Canadian company Research in Motion by the governments of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and India add up to a business story, not a foreign-affairs story.

This is just one example of a larger political failure in Canada to appreciate the full foreign-policy potential of

communication technology.

 In the United States, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called for a "21st-century statecraft" that harnesses tools
 such as Twitter and text messages.

 Articles this summer in The New York Times Magazine and Foreign Policy have called it "digital diplomacy." Some,

 such as Canadian diplomacy expert Daryl Copeland, call it "e-diplomacy."

 In 2010, the world sees Canada through YouTube.

 "Diplomacy in the international arena is no longer about the big-D diplomat charging in on his white horse and

 expounding the virtues of Canada at cocktail parties," says Shauna Sylvester, who was the director of Canada's
 World, a three-year non-governmental project consulting citizens about foreign policy.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771280 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

The United Kingdom's Digital Diplomacy web portal (yes, it has one) defines digital diplomacy as "solving foreign

policy problems using the Internet." Social-media enthusiasts often talk about the wisdom of crowds; post a problem

on the Internet today, and someone, somewhere, will post a solution tomorrow.

No one's likely to craft peace in the Middle East by creating a Facebook page. But Facebook pages, and other
social media, can shift global public opinion in new directions. That, in turn, affects Canada's tourism, trade,

security, immigration.

Canada's government has done some important work in digital diplomacy. "Canada was a pioneer in this field," says

Copeland.

In 2003, for example, Canadian Foreign Minister Bill Graham solicited online comments about policy questions.

In 2005, the government created a virtual network called Connect2Canada.com        "for friends of Canada and

Canadians in the United States." It's still going strong and is a good example of 21st-century government
communication, including an "ask the ambassador" link and a YouTube channel.

More recently, the government created an impressive, if unwieldy, interactive site for the G20 summit. It is also

actively "correcting misinformation" in social media when it comes to the seal hunt.

But Sylvester says the enthusiasm for open government seemed to fade after the Conservatives took office in 2006.

"Engagement was no longer part of the government's role."

There are people who get it in the public service today, and some very good initiatives. There are even a few

ministers who get Twitter. But there is no Hillary Clinton pushing the government to do better, no office of digital
diplomacy working on a strategy.

How we do it is almost as important as whether we do it at all. The tactic the government has taken on the seal hunt,

for example, could have the intended effect of countering inaccuracy, or it could come across as a heavy-handed

attempt to control the debale, especially if the government's not simultaneously engaged in more crowd-pleasing
ways to get its message across. Some governments have had fun with social media, opening virtual embassies on

Second Life, for example.

Wikipedia edits are another tricky area. As for seeding Twitter and the blogosphere with Canadian values, it has to

be done with care. Security analyst Peter Jones points out that if, for example, an Iranian blogger becomes too
closely associated with the West, his or her credibility could suffer.

The field of digital diplomacy is new, and fraught with risks. The opportunities, though, are exciting.

In that New York Times Magazine article, Alec Ross, Clinton's senior adviser for innovation, said the key question

for 21st-century statecraft is "Is it open or is it closed?" That's a sensitive question for this Conservative government.

A real advance in e-diplomacy, a real engagement in the split-second, wide-open, on-the-record world of Twitter and

Wikipedia, requires a prime minister who is willing to let public servants and diplomats have a constant unmediated
conversation with the public. It means relinquishing central control of the message.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771280 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

The alternative is to fade into irrelevance. Because that big, messy, whirlwind global conversation's going to happen

anyway, whether Canada's part of it or not.

The Political Scene

The Empty Chamber

Just how broken is the Senate?

Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the

Obama Administration....
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills

passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate....

"Sit and watch us for seven days," one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. "You know what you'll see happening?

Nothing."

"This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'"

Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.
"It's unconscionable," Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. "The obstructionism has become

mindless."
The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly

behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and
top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.

"Also, it's a dumb rule in itself," McCaskill said. "It's time we started looking at some of these rules."

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and
subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had

scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general

and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and
McCaskill's Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training

of Afghan police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a
victory ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-

care reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most
embarrassing sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who

had fought the bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.
So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard

Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. "I have no personal objection to
continuing," Burr said. But, he added, "there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object."

Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In
general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be

present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their
first look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2.     The

presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce
them to the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about

the Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, "Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the
floor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they're

doing in China right now?"
Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name

every few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the
 press lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of

interest actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers.
On this afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the

 transcription machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate
 chamber is an intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.

 Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to
 hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some

 built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority
 and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,

 "Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and
 not be distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule."

 The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon;
 the general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators

 these days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-
 term successes while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.

 Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three
 amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an

 amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch
 the amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was

 to finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the
 only thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty

 minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to
 yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,

 would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.
 Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, "This is the first time in recent

 memory that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to
 kill the reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are

 defeated."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. "The position on the other side

of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good," he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose
half an octave. "Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an

inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an
inconvenience."

The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded
Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to

emphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides
the chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third

person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the
moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's "Manual of

Parliamentary Practice"—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from
insulting any senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting

at Al Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: "Mr. President, make no mistake, the
intent of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform.... A

senator on the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill
health-care reform!"

The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: "The time of the senator has expired."
For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that

happens on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the
Democrats while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that

it wouldn't have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had
been designed to make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically

supports. One amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on
individuals making less than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and

outlandish. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom
Coburn, a Republican obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with

mental illness would not be denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent "convicted child molesters, rapists,
and sex offenders" from buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was

allotted to explain his Viagra amendment without cracking a smile. "This is not a game amendment," he insisted. "It
actually saves money."

So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.
"The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate," Baucus declared. "It is a crass

political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy." Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a
clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. "Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins." Thirty-five-second pause. "Mr. Conrad, Mr.

Corker." Ten seconds. "Mr. Cornyn." Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they're
so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues

milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John
McCain—now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed,

trying to catch the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben
 Nelson, of Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.

The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled
drone was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, "Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!"

Sporadically, a sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could
charm into laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo

 animals—Levin a shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one
 displayed a limited set of behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and

 clamped his hands down on a colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which
 senators were loners (Russ Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which
 senators were important (Dick Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).

 Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through

 her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. "Can we

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

get some order?" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It

was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.
Harry Reid controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.

Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous
negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,

unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was
hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the

chamber to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow,
of Michigan, her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion

momentarily eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face,
as if casting her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, "The longest it lasted was thirty

seconds."
At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just

found two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the
bill would go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the

Capitol's northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty
streets. On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if

waiting for someone to take him away.
The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the

Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. "Everyone's
tired," Reid declared before the final vote. "This legislative fight is one for the record books." He was so fatigued that he

initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. "Way to go, Lindsey, way
to stretch it out," Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the

losing team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a
moment the chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.

The Senate is often referred to as "the world's greatest deliberative body." Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from
Oregon, said, "That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of

exchange of ideas, is so limited." Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a
Republican and a Democrat. "The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation occurring

in which they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber."
Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.

"You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue," he said.
Instead, a senator typically gives "a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets

up and gives a speech on a completely different subject." From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a
colloquy—"I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantage

plan"—that has been scripted in advance by aides.
While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits

from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.
Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same

morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a
hearing can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an

unwritten rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows
senators to spend four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their

families in their home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless
fund-raising, and to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the

House, in 1995, he told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former
Democratic leader, said, "When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one
 hundred senators there was Wednesday afternoon."

 Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, "Of any free

time you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more," is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own
campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on

 behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate
 office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, "It sucks up time that a
senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues."

In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took
time to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a

million dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry
groups were spending $1.4 million   .a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-

raising and lobbying, said, "People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The
over-all bills are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money."

Daschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: "Sometimes, you're dialling for

dollars, you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the
floor, your staff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double

check—but, just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye
vote, or a no vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up

sometimes. But, if you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope
nobody asks, because I don't have a clue."

Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past
few decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff

members, who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional
relationships, tend to push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—

writing bills, negotiating the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox or MSNBC.
One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. "You know about all

these rags that cover the Hill, right?" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, CongressDaily,
and CO Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of

the "24/7 media," provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a "dust-up" between Scott
Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South

Carolina; the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront
DeMint on the Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators

have a young press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of
political obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go

unreported because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to
the Senate in 1981 and will leave next January, told me, "I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who

covered me on a daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications
only see me through the prism of conflict." Lamar Alexander described the effect as "this instant radicalizing of positions

to the left and the right."
Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly

fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan cooperation is still
permissible. "A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution," Gregg said. "Substantive,

thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside."
Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus

lunch to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one
another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses

who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill
Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall

has set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the
seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: "In those days Democrats and

Republicans actually enjoyed each other's company.") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim
DeMint, Dodd said, "Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well." He repeated something that

Jon Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: "There's no trust." Dodd, whose father was a
senator, went on, "That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with

that conclusion. And if that's missing ... "
There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party

as "friends." Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as "one of my best friends in the Senate,"
and both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining.
Udall noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But

opportunities to bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the "inner
sanctum," where Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the

seventies, old bulls such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan did. "You learned, and also you found out what was going on," Dodd said, adding, "It's awfully difficult to say

crappy things about someone that you just had lunch with." These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty.

Senators eat lunch in their respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else "downtown," which means
asking donors for money over steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the "caucus lunch"

was instituted by Republicans in the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980,
followed suit. Caucus lunches work members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican

lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry Reid as an idiot. "At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors,"
Alexander joked, adding, "We spend most of our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other."

In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. "They kind of dwindled off during
the health-care debate," Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few

months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,
joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.

These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers
who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson,

of Wisconsin, put it this way: "Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?"
The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.

The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.
For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a

levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply
impressed by the quality of its members: "They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous

instincts animating it, not the petty passions." But he also recognized that "a minority of the nation dominating the
Senate could completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the

spirit of constitutional government." As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented
statesmen, Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.

Robert A. Caro, in "Master of the Senate," the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War
the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster,

Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the
Presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of

Southern racists and Republican corporate shills, and was "the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed
themselves in vain—the chief obstructive force in the federal government." By the fifties, the Senate had become far

 more conservative than the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book "Citadel," called the
Senate "to a most peculiar degree, a Southern Institution ... growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly"

and "the only place in the country where the South did not lose the war."
 By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise and

Consent," based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and
 Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works,

 in its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one
 another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-

 raisers, no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.
 In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's "famous 'club' atmosphere is

 based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand.... They thrust
 hard at one another in debate over serious matters," but, he writes, "understanding and accommodation in the ordinary

 course of the Senate day was essential to sanity." Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the
 Senate to his will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either "whales"—the heavyweight

 chairmen who negotiated legislation—or "minnows," the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when,
 in 1958, a formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy,

 and Philip Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of "The Fall of the
 House of Roosevelt," worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. "They used to talk to each other—

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

that's my most vivid recollection," he said. "If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners

would come in to hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a
deliberative body, drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically." Senators who ran for office in order to work on

foreign policy, social welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. "But if you wanted to do something
there was a mechanism by which you could do it," Janeway said.

In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and
moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of

those decades as "a bipartisan liberal institution." The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the
Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,

campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed
jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was

passed, in 1965, it won 70-24.
The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church,

Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan "field
hearings" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole's indispensable support,

greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's
legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and

said, "You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That's
how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly." Humphrey's career advice: "You should become Mr. Housing.

Housing is the future."
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and

accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. "The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of
people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs," Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled.

"They were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to
Republicans in the Senate today." Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,

who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, "It was a huge loss of the most experienced,
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there

less than six years." He added, "The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets
worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others

didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'"
After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals

began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. "So Damn Much Money," a recent book by the Washington Post
reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans

began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan
coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own

fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members
of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to

 regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in
the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and

escalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats
filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-

called "nuclear option." Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went
to South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years

 earlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.
 The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,

 independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that
 every election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The

 Senate, no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main
 action was between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican

 Senate majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.
 Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly

 become populated by "ideologues and charlatans." He went on, "When we do get good people who come in, they very

 quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

there." He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year
working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with

angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about "pulling the plug
on Grandma." Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin "altering his behavior and

abandoning every issue, including campaign-finance reform."

One morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.
A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the

111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger
down the list of senators. He did it again. "I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this."

He was stumped. "Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time."
He put the directory aside. "I'm just having the damnedest time."

Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was
hired last year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to

JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm's chairman, until

President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with
which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became

lobbyists. In 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned
and formed a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a

two-year waiting period between serving and lobbying.
When you spend your days at the Senate, it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems

miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute

thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says "Men's Gallery"), and

the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where
senators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over

the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.
Riddick, called "Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices," which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was

known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding
officer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.

After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's "Advise and Consent" is still faintly visible. "The Senate, by its
nature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount," Lamar Alexander said. "And that's

not changed." Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its
members to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, "To have a chamber

that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please."
 In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one

(counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia;
liberals, like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of

 Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of
senior senators. "If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific," Chris Dodd said. "My worry is they won't stay. Because it's

 not productive."
The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in a dynamic new era. Instead, their

 young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and "secret holds"—when a senator
 anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire

 McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds,
 and Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical

 gamesmanship between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first
 year. Michael Bennet said, "We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small

 ones, and where things have been put off for a really long period of time." He mentioned the national debt, energy
 policy, and the financial crisis. "Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it."

 We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with
 bottled water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

moving. Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already
has to defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to

grow too attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: "And
then some more veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.'

As the fifteen months or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems."
Earlier this year, the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th,

CongressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy
Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office

maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent
several days and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of

unemployed Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, "Tough shit." (Eventually,

Republicans persuaded Bunning to stop.)
These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,

Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In
2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more

senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called "rolling holds"—and their party leader facilitates the game by
keeping their names secret.

Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of
partisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed

time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-
authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used

rule that allowed the "previous question" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by
the eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and

talking until their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word "filibuster" comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for "looter.")
In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,

which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a "cloture" vote. For decades, the rule was
rarely used; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies

and eighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower
the threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a

year, as both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the
Republicans lost their majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture

votes in 2007 and 2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills

passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. "Why?" Steny Hoyer, the
outraged Democratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. "Because they do not do their business in a way that

facilitates noncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate." Last week, six
House Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.

Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the

Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to

 run the General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection
was substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's "Senate Procedure" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and

vote. Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading
aloud of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist;

Senate clerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in
frustration.

 Under McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative
 maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first

 proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues "nihilists," who want to create chaos because
 it serves their ideology. "If there's chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions," Harkin said. "In chaos people don't

 listen to reason." McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican
 strategy reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times, "To the extent that they"—the

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

Democrats—"want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be
helpful. To the extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful."

One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after
vote. Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana;

Susan Collins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus?
Alexander said that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, "When you have your back against the wall and

the gallows are hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind."
Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: "He said

if we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant." Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster
a military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad

Cochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that
he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings

disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with

the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose
cloture, and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)

Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus
bill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-

care-reform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against
the version that went before the full Senate. "I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance

Committee version—it grew by a thousand pages," Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White
House officials that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices, and said that the

Democrats "did not accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch." McConnell
was able to exploit her alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: "She actually said to me once

that she had never felt the pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to
her or quite as real or troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this

together. You're a senior Republican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and
you're going to do it.'"

Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the
senator who helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly

maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn't give him the leverage
of McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.

In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per
cent of the country's population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a

few new senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.
Tom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent

time in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior
Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is

a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,
in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.

"I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas," he said. "Then to be on the inside—the
thing that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show."

 In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.
 Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend

 them, making it extremely difficult. ("Rule XXII is a Catch-22," Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different
 idea—the "constitutional option." Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that "each House may determine the

 Rules of its Proceedings" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January
 and propose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority.

 There's even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three
 times, most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.

 At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings
 on the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when

 the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized
 working groups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

chairs by caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were
competing for the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other

for Majority Leader.)
For Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. "If you want a

parliamentary form of government, go over to the House," Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. "Why even run for the
Senate?" Udall's plan for next January, he said, would be a "gigantic mistake."

"They'll get over it," Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. "And they'll get over it quicker if

they're in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider
whatever they have to say." He added that the Senate "may be getting done about as much as the American people

want done." The President's ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of
the Republicans I spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is "broken." Alexander claimed that he and other

Republicans were exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate.
"The Senate wasn't created to be efficient," he argued. "It was created to be inefficient." At one of the filibuster

hearings, in April, Alexander, sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the
Republicans with obstructing legislation, "we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our

right to debate, our right to offer amendments, which is the essence of the Senate."
Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is

inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah
Binder, a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the

filibuster, and so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. "I would oppose that," Chris Dodd said, adding of
the freshmen, "These are people who have never been in the minority." For older Democrats, who have put in their

years, grown adept at working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat.
(Among senior senators, the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being

divided not between whales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too
accustomed to the Senate's ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate

Republicans are too weak to challenge the newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.
Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic,

wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,
who have created a culture where Tocqueville's "lofty thoughts" and "generous impulses" have no place.

A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial
regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win

real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout
Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs

appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and
evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to pass

a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.
The affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first

term, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of

Virginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having
 to do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They

 worked through the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were
 members of a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke,

 Alan Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still
 talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate's "Odd Couple." By February, they had finished

 their work.
 Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,

 dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the
 committee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed

 McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. "It was an odd place to be," Corker recalled. "And yet that night we
 began meeting." The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In

 response, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

lobbyists that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other
Republicans of the Party's line on financial reform.)

On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, "You've been a great
partner." He was ending their talks after only a month. "It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest," Corker told reporters

afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the
rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks

under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other
Republicans with him. "Baloney," Corker said. "If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we'd've had at least twenty-

five Republican votes."

The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike,
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar

fund, paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of
another crisis. But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was

now parroting talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a "partisan bill"
that "will guarantee perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks." McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-

one Republicans, suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded

with his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, "Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the
rhetoric. Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do.... W e were

supposed to be the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat
down with cooler heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot

do that on financial regulation, an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it ..." Corker didn't
allow the thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.

Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: "I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced
with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I

am not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue ... then
why are we even here?" He went on, "We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is

looking out for their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority
seems intent on proving them right.... I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know

there are friends of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate,
who want to be part of the solution."

 In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted, "I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four

or five months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it.... I
 have to say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!"

Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. "You and I went a long
way," Corker told Dodd. "Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats

on your committee."
"And I was not gaining Republicans," Dodd replied.

 "You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did
 not leave the table." Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few

 days.
 But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-

 reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists
 prowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the

 ornate Reception Room with Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of
 furniture scraping across a tile floor. "Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room," Manley said. "Very little happens

 around here without a deadline." The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A
 few weeks later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform

 finally came to a vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He
 had even voted for an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have

 scrapped Corker's work of many months with Warner.

•	    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

"The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained
office, under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. "It's the Senate, I guess." McConnell's strategy of obstruction

had once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a "shrinking number" of Republicans were
frustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, "God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking

member on this." Collins responded, "We could have had such a great time on this bill."
Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because "the American people don't trust either political party

enough to give them a blank check," was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. "There was zero
substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes," he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the

bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, "If you want to vote against something,
you can always find your reasons."

But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating
himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of

thirty minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. "I am obviously disappointed," he said. "I think I have

spent as much time as any senator.... on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good
things in it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not

enough time was spent on some of the core issues."
As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of "So Damn Much Money," in the press gallery. I

later asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of
the Senate. "If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away

money and interest groups," he said. "But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things
considered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here

you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet."
After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,

smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, "For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it
didn't work." He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with "some Nevadans."

Durbin said, "I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take
to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?"

Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, "I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its
business much as our founders intended. We did that."

On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial
regulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They

depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,

Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the
year. And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign

finance, transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial
appointments on the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you

can feel the Senate slipping back into stagnant waters.

                Re: Q's secret bid to UK

                On the morning of June 2, 2011 sensitive sources with access to the advisors to Muammar
                Qaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, stated in strict confidence that the Libyan government has opened
                extremely complicated negotiations with the government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an

                effort to obtain their support in reaching a ceasefire agreement with the rebels of the Libyan
                Transitional National Council (TNC), allowing the Qaddafi's to maintain some level of control
                in the country.

                This initiative is directed by Saif al-Islam and, according to these sensitive sources, the Libyans
                have asked the UK officials to broker a deal with the TNC that will allow some form of power

                sharing, with the possibility of Saif al-Islam acting as head of state and the TNC members
                making up a substantial portion of the cabinet in a new government. Under the plan Muammar
                Qaddafi would be allowed to leave the country and go into exile with no danger of indictment on

                charges of human rights abuses and corruption by Libyan or international courts.

                (Source Comment: In the opinion of these sensitive sources, this initiative reflects the concern of

                the Qaddafi government that as a result of continuing NATO air raids against their forces, they
                can no longer defeat the rebel army. They add that there has been no firm response from the UK
                government, and the initial discussions have been conducted by officers of the British Special

                Intelligence Service (SIS / MI-6). In the opinion of these same sources the initial idea of these
                talks may have been raised by former Libyan Foreign Minister Mousa Kousa, after his arrival in
                London in late March 2011.)

                According to these sensitive sources, Saif al-Islam and his advisors realize that there is little
                chance the TNC will agree to such an offer, and that SIS may be using this contact as a means of

                collecting intelligence while protecting British interests in Libya. Notwithstanding this concern,
                in the opinion of these individuals, Saif al-Islam believes that introducing the possibility of a
                ceasefire and the subsequent negotiations may create divisions within NATO and weaken their

                military operations against Qaddafi's forces.

                   the United States and the other NATO allies.)

                   At the same time, sources with access to the operations of the TNC military committee state
                   privately that on June 1, 2011 Libyan intelligence officers detonated a car bomb outside the

                   Tibesti Hotel in the TNC capital of Benghazi. One person was injured in the blast and a number
                   of nearby vehicles were damaged. TNC security officers occupied the hotel and the surrounding

                   area immediately after the attack, but were not able to identif3r any of the attackers. The Tibesti
                   Hotel is an important landmark in the heart of Benghazi and is used by the TNC government, as

                   well by foreign journalists and diplomats. Hotel security has been heightened in the hours
                   following the attack and all foreign residents are under surveillance by TNC security officers,

                   looking for suspicious activities and contacts.

Media coverage in many countries of WikiLeaks releases is decreasing, with new stories from wire services on
Assanage  and Interpol and the latest Russia reports. Reporting on specific cables is shifting to more local
issues, such as US military use of Ireland's Shannon Airport or US interest in Iran's activities in
Peru. Governments and many commentators assert US relationships will not be significantly damages, and

there are frequent observations that the releases have not revealed "anything new." Anti-US writers and media
continue to use the opportunity to skewer the United States.

Many of the items below are digests of more extensive Embassy reporting. Additional reporting is available

from post email submissions.

AF:

Burundi

Swahili Bonesha FM   radio broadcast a report that a Spanish official told Embassy Madrid that Russia, Belarus,
and Chechnya had become a mafia states, and also mentioned anti-terrorism expert Russell Travers would
investigate the leak. The story suggested the leaks have embarrassed US diplomats.

Mali
No local mention in print or broadcast media in Mali.

Niger

No local media coverage.

Zimbabwe
An online website reports Zimbabwean political parties in a fragile coalition government on Tuesday dismissed

 WikiLeaks revelations that a power sharing deal between them is doomed because of acute differences between
rival politicians.

NEA:

 Jordan

Most local newspapers carry wire reports on Assange's legal situation. Dailies also cited Assange calling for
Secretary Clinton to if it's proved she ordered American diplomats to spy on U.N. officials. Local dailies focus
on Iran's President Ahmadinejad saying "the documents lack the legality and the credibility and they will not

affect on Iran's relations with other countries in the region." Dailies also focused on one alleged report that
Syrian President Al-Asad's "is not convinced Iran is developing nuclear weapons." There is no mention of the
Jordan-specific leaks in any print media.

A columnist writing for Al -Ghad contends the leaks will not harm the region or the US, although they could
undermine trust. He sates the documents show that the positions of the US and Middle Eastern states on

regional issues is clear. Another columnist writing for the same paper catalogues criticisms of international
leaders and concludes by wondering "what will happen next."

EIJR:

Azerbaijan
The only Azerbaijan-specific newspaper reporting is an article in opposition daily Yeni Musavat containing a
denial by the Bank of Baku of an allegation that it is involved in Iran's sanction-busting. Wide coverage of a
document comparing President Aliyev to both Sonny and Michael Corleone in the online news websites. TV
maintains tone that Wikileaks is criminal conspiracy and that the documents are inaccurate.

Finland

Coverage continues, but much reduced. Focus has shifted to the refusal of Finnish authorities, notably
President Halonen and FM Stubb, to comment on revelations about Finland that have emerged from the leaks.
Much speculation has focused on suggestions in the leaked documents that China had pressured Finland not to
accept Uigur prisoners being released by the U.S. from Guantanamo Bay. Finnish officials continue to assert
publicly that the leaks will not affect relations with the United States. It was also reported that Finland has no
plans to reassess its own policy on confidentiality. Commentary speculates about what may be revealed in the
future, but expects little damage to relations.

Germany
Coverage is still primarily focused on the domestic impact of the leaks, particularly on the hunt for the young
politician who allegedly provided the U.S. Embassy with confidential government documents. Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitungand Sueddeutsche Zeitungsaid in a joint editorial that "those in Germany who thought
North Korea was a dark empire but not a real threat have been proven wrong by the WikiLeaks revelations."

Der Spiegel is continuing to publish new material on roughly the same timeline and topics as the New York
Times; today's coverage focused on Russia and was substantively the same as the English-language reporting
over the past few days.

Ireland
Media is focusing on specific revelations about the use of Shannon Airport by the U.S. military. According to

the Irish Daily Mirror "it appears the (Irish) government was not serious about dealing with real concerns about
the use of Shannon by the U.S. military on their way to Iraq and Afghanistan. Bloggers opine the Irish
government felt conflicted — it liked the revenue it received from U.S. troops passing through, as well as the
diplomatic benefits, but felt it had to placate the Irish public before the 2007 elections and publicly decry the
use of Shannon. The Irish Examiner relied on an excerpt from TIME Magazine's interview with Assange. An
analyst writing for the Irish Independent headlines "Diplomatic corps' horror is pure gold for historians,"

concluding that, ith 900 further Irish cables set to be published in the coming months, the trouble may only be
starting for the mandarins of Iveagh House (Department of Foreign Affairs)."

 Malta
 Interest in Wikileaks continues in the online media, with comments on the more general revelations. There
 were no new pieces about Malta itself.

Montenegro
Over the course of the last two days, the Wikileaks story has moved from the cover pages and headlines of

Montenegro's media to the international news sections. All major electronic and print media carried the first
official statement of a Montenegrin official on the topic. PM Djukanovic said American diplomats were doing
their job and nothing can spoil the US-Montenegran relationship. There was wire coverage of the Interpol
warrant and Secretary Clinton at the OSCE.

Portugal

Calling it"an Invaluable Service to Democracy, a columnist for Niblico condemns "the orders that American
diplomats received to collect personal information from high-ranking international officials, and in particular,
Ban Ki-Moon's." He concludes that "The future of freedom is linked to the security and integrity of our
personal data— and I do not knowthat the U.S., after having lost 250,000 of its secret documents, is in any
conditionto guarantee either one of them."

Switzerland:
Swiss press reports feature extensive coverage; however, very little new information. Items reported included
preparations for a Clinton meeting with Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey in 2009; the Swiss - Libya
affair; FBI-Swiss Federal Police liaison in 2006; Papers also reported that Julian Assange has contacts in
Switzerland and that a Swiss citizen from Basel is allegedly in charge of processing donations for

Wikileaks. According to the press, Assange met representatives of the Swiss Pirate Party in Geneva. Finally,
Swiss papers took up the story that Wikileaks might be targeting Bank of America, writing that the bank is
trying to calm down the stock markets. The NZZ  published two opinion pieces. Both critical of the leaks for the
harm they do to diplomacy.

WHA:

Brazil

Brazilian media today featured extensive coverage. Folha de Sao Paulo  dedicated six pages, including an op-ed
by Ambassador Shannon outlining the U.S. viewpoint. Folha's   editorial said the information released is
relevant but neither surprising nor dangerous, while another outlet praised efforts by certain papers to filter the
information and adding that Wikileaks is on the whole valuable to society. A commentator inFolha wrote that
President Lula should not so quickly dismiss the U.S. observations about the GoB (which he claimed are likely

accurate), and another used the documents' description of President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin to
analyze the possible role of Lula in the Rousseff Administration.

Cuba
Cuban  media coverage continues at levels similar to yesterday's. OnlineCubadebate and Juventudrebelde.cu
publish wide-ranging articles, many of them culled from news wires, covering USG reaction, third country
reaction (Canada), and Wikileaks reaction (Julian Assange's "insurance" against prosecution and accusations

that Amazon violated the First Amendment). In commentary,    Granma's  Manuel E. Yepe, a Cuban lawyer,
economist, journalist and former Cuban ambassador to Romania, suggests that Wikileaks "yielded to pressure
from the USG and the media in managing how and when information was released, and insinuates that right
wing elements in the U.S. are behind the disclosure of the documents.

Eastern Caribbean:

Reporting continues to be general, with the exception of one radio report StarCom's LOVE FM 104.1     that
WikiLeaks may soon release cables about the Caribbean, and mentioning that the U.S. Embassy in Port of Spain
released a statement that WikiLeaks' actions jeopardize the U.S. national security.

Ecuador

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776619 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

Discussion continues to dominate the front pages of major newspapers as well as the editorial pages--with an
increase in the number of opinion articles. Press continues to report and opine on the invitation to Ecuador
offered by Deputy Foreign Minister Kintto Lucas to Assange and the subsequent disclaimer and withdrawal of

the invitation by President Correa. Most articles criticized Lucas for his error. A tongue-in-cheek editorial in
Universo  "The Coming of Julian" expressed regrets that Assange would not be coming to Ecuador as he might
have revealed the secrets of the GOE and then would have faced the same or worse treatment that Ecuadorian
investigative journalists receive.

El Salvador
A columnist for El Diario de Hoy  asked "What is the big deal?" He said the cables about Honduras "tell us
   that the American diplomats were lost and did not understand what was happening" during the coup
there. Any Ambassador who is not reporting on the mental state of people like Hugo Chavez, Daniel Ortega,
Evo Moralesand    Cristina Kirchner, is not doing his job ... This is all so routine that it cannot greatly affect
American diplomacy ..." Salvadoran media reporting continues to rely almost exclusively on wire

stories. Locally produced articles and TV/radio reports have focused on reaction from Foreign Minister
Martinez and Ambassador Aponte, both of whom have repeatedly explained the nature of diplomatic
correspondence and have underscored the strength of the US-Salvadoran bilateral relationship.

Honduras
The buzz around the WikiLeaks scandal is slowly taking a backseat —for now -- to Honduran issues such as
                                                had a positive editorial arguing countries maintain relations
taxes and security issues. Conservative Tribuna
with each other based on national interest. It suggested "the importance of the U.S. on the global stage will
ensure that other countries will continue to work closely with Washington in the pursuit of those interests." An
op-ed in liberal dailyTiempo  titled "In defense of Ambassador Hugo Llorens," stressed that diplomats must
provide honest advice to their government.  Tiempo's  op-ed claims that "the documents divulged so far
havebeen, in their majority, frivolities without importance, however highly sensitive and dangerous issues could
pop up in them...[d]iplomacy is a prolonged example of hypocrisy and cynicism."

Mexico
El Universal  in its editorial questions the wholesale, unfiltered dumping of classified information; "the fact that
a government hides something does not make it damnable. It's normal.. .for diplomats to prepare reports about
the countries and leaders where they are posted." The paper asserts that "it may be interesting to know that
U.S. officials had questions about the mental health of the president of Argentina, but the benefit to citizens of

such a revelation is marginal in proportion to the potential damage to relations between the two countries." An
op-ed writer for El Universal, claims that the "released documents show U.S. diplomats rummaging through
 personal lives and privately mocking the same leaders whom they publicly treat as friends." Another dailyLa
 Jornada's in its editorial concludes that "the main factor of diplomatic tension and greatest security risk to
 world peace is not Wikileaks but Washington's belligerent, unilateral and imperialist warmongering, aggravated
 now by its defense of opacity."

 Peru
 Peru media are focusing on the first alleged cable to come from Peru, on US concern about Iran's interest in
 Peru's uranium, as well as regional "revelations" in regards neighboring Chile, Venezuela and Argentina. TV,
 radio and internet reflect similar slants.

 Venezuela

 Articles on Interpol's "Red Notice" for Julian Assange appeared in most dailies.El Nacional cites assessments
 by the Embassy's Economic Counselor about the development of nuclear energy in Venezuela.      El Mundo
 reports alleged comments by then Ambassador Duddy describing the Venezuelan bank interventions in
 November 2009. A columnist in government owned        Correo de Orinoco  says accuses the U.S. of diplomatic
 'excesses,' torture in occupied territories, hiring contractors that fire on crowds, using lies to justify wars in
 Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen. Taking a different tack, an Op-Ed in  El Universal remarks sarcastically, "the

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776619 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

U.S. does not have friends, only interests. Bold discovery! Only the ignorant, the naïve, or the crazy — or a
combination of those three —can say that this constitutes an international declassification." An article in the
online edition ofLa Verdadof Maracaibo speculates the State Department is using Wikileaks to put out

information it does not want to release directly.

</span>

OSLO (Reuters) -   Norway said on Monday it was "perfectly legitimate" for Palestinians to take their case for
statehood to the United Nations for voting in September.

   "We will consider very carefully the proposed text that's to be put forward by the Palestinians in the coming

weeks," said Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere, with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas
beside him at a press conference.

   "Norway believes it is perfectly legitimate for the Palestinian president to turn to the United Nations with

such proposals," Stoere said, adding that continued negotiations with Israel will be required in any case.

   The United States and Israel have opposed Abbas's plan, backed by the Arab League, to bring the
Palestinians' long quest for statehood to a vote in New York.

   Abbas said on Monday the plan was still on.

   "We will seek to go to the U.N. next September in order to obtain membership for the state of Palestine," he

said.

   He added: "Our way is to go to the Security Council. If we fail we will go to the General Assembly."

   Norwegian diplomats said U.N. membership would require approval by the Security Council, where the
United States holds veto power, but that a resolution on statehood could go straight to the U.N. General
Assembly.

   Stoere said Norway would decide how to vote after reading the exact proposal but left little doubt about his
inclination.

   "I don't think that any Palestinians or anybody around the world are in doubt that Norway supports

Palestinians' right to statehood," he said. "That has to be accompanied by a process of negotiation, which at the
moment is stalling."

   He and Abbas signed a document upgrading the Palestinian Authority's representative in Norway to

ambassadorial rank, as several other European nations have done.

   Norway chairs a group of Palestinian donor nations, some of which have contributed to a funding crisis for
Abbas by not fulfilling funding pledges. Stoere implored them to pay up.

Subject: Palestinians say will work with Blair (Reuters)
</span>

RAMALLAH (Reuters) - A senior Palestinian official on Wednesday added his voice to calls for the
replacement of international Middle East envoy Tony Blair, but the office of Palestinian President Mahmoud
Abbas said it would carry on cooperating with the former British leader.

   "The Palestinian presidency will continue to work with the envoy of the international Quartet Committee
Tony Blair in his capacity as the choice of the Quartet," presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah said in a
brief statement.

   It made no direct reference to calls from senior Palestinians for the replacement of Blair, whom they accused
of bias in favour of Israel.

   Mohammed Ishtayeh, a member of the Central Committee of the dominant Fatah movement and a confidant

of Abbas, told Voice of Palestine radio earlier on Wednesday that Blair was no longer trusted to be an impartial
mediator.

   Ishtayeh said the Palestinians had also written to the Quartet of mediating powers which Blair represents --

the European Union, United States, Russia and United Nations -- to say its latest proposition for a resumption of
stalled peace negotiations was too vague to be meaningful.

   Quartet envoys were due to meet in Brussels on Sunday.

   "We do not expect much of the Quartet. There is discontent with its envoy Mr. Tony Blair," Ishtayeh said.
"Our general evaluation of his ,efforts is that he has become of no use at all. He has developed a large bias in

favour of the Israeli side and he has lost a lot of his credibility.

   "We hope the Quartet will reconsider the appointment of this person," he added, in the most explicit public
suggestion to date that influential Palestinians want Blair to go.

   The presidential spokesman did not allude to recent negative statements about the envoy.

   FOCUS ON QUARTET

   Abu Rdainah urged the Quartet, and Blair, to "exert every possible effort to compel Israel to accept the last

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05782678 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

statement of the Quartet committee by deeds, not words, through finding a mechanism to stop (Jewish)
settlement in Palestinian lands".

   A call by the Quartet for the rapid resumption of talks without preconditions was turned down by the
Palestine Liberation Organisation last week but accepted by Israel.

   The Palestinians say the Quartet failed to explicitly require Israel to stop building on occupied land in the
West Bank and East Jerusalem -- the only condition under which they will agree to restart direct peace talks.

   The Quartet formula demanding that neither side undertake unilateral acts which could interfere with the
talks was simply too vague, PLO official Ishtayeh said.

   "I believe the Quartet needs to work on itself more than anything else ... The situation does not permit
ambiguity. Either settlement stops or there will be no negotiation."

   A spokesman for Blair said Ishtayeh's comments did not reflect Blair's conversations with the Palestinian
leadership.

   He said it was the role of the Quartet representative to interact with both sides "not least so that we can
continue to deliver change on the ground for Palestinians to improve their quality of life".

   Blair has been the Quartet's envoy since 2007, focusing on easing the practical conditions of Israel's military
occupation of the West Bank so the Palestinian economy can develop and form a solid foundation on which
Abbas's Palestinian Authority can build the infrastructure of a future state.

   The economy has grown and in the past two years Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad has created
most of the attributes of statehood, in government institutions, administration and security. But Israeli forces
remain in ultimate control.

   Since peace talks collapsed a year ago, with the expiry of an Israeli moratorium on settlement construction,

the Palestinians have shifted the focus of their efforts to a bid for statehood at the United Nations, where Abbas
formally lodged an application for full membership last month.

   The United States has said it will veto that step, insisting along with Israel that a Palestinian state can only

come into being via a negotiated, comprehensive treaty with Israel to resolve the 63-year-old Middle East
conflict.

 The Security Council has adopted a new resolution to promote Libya's recovery from its recent conflict

 and support its transition to a free society. This resolution mandates a new, three-month UN mission
 that will assist Libyan efforts to restore security and the rule of law, protect human rights, and undertake

 an inclusive political dialogue towards establishing a democratic government. It also begins the process

 of unwinding UN sanctions that were imposed last spring in response to the Qadhafi regime's brutal

• Supports efforts by Libya's National Transitional Council (TNC) to restore stability and bring democracy

to Libya.

o The Security Council underscored the need for an inclusive, representative political process that will

authorities to restore public security and the rule of law; undertake an inclusive political dialogue;
embark upon the establishment of a constitution and electoral process; promote and protect human

rights; and coordinate international assistance.

 oUNSMIL will be headed by a Special Representative of the Secretary-General.

 • Creates new exemptions to the UN arms embargo.

 o States are now free to provide security assistance to the new Libyan authorities, provided that they

 notify the Security Council's Libya Sanctions Committee.

 o A new exemption to the arms embargo makes it easier for UN, media and humanitarian personnel to
 protect themselves.

 o The existing UN arms embargo otherwise stays in place, allowing international partners to help prevent

 dangerous weapons flows into and out of Libya.

 • Lifts sanctions entirely on key Libyan oil companies.

 o By terminating sanctions on Libya's most important economic sector, this resolution jumpstarts Libya's

 economic recovery.

   Facilitates the resumption of economic activity.

o Assets that were previously frozen as a result of the UN sanctions will remain frozen until the Libyan

institutions are well-positioned to receive them.

for certain urgent needs.

 •	ases restrictions on Libyan-operated aircraft flying abroad.

o Libyan-owned and -operated aircraft will now be able to make humanitarian           ,and other authorized

flights, thereby facilitating the resumption of additional air traffic, provided that the flights are

authorized   through the existing NATO process.

 •Keeps in place the no-fly zone and protection of civilians provisions.

o In light of continued fighting in some parts of Libya, member states and NATO will continue to be

authorized to use force to enforce the no-fly zone, protect civilians and enforce the arms embargo.

o The Council will keep these measures under continuous review and lift them when circumstances

permit.

In Syria, world inaction fuels armed revolt

Wednesday, Jan 18, 2012

BEIRUT — Growing indications that a deeply divided international community is either unable or unwilling to intervene

to halt the violence in Syria are fueling an armed rebellion that risks plunging the country, and perhaps the region, into a
 wider war.

 The slide toward all-out conflict seemed to accelerate Wednesday after the opposition claimed that Syrian government

 forces had been forced to accept a cease-fire negotiated with rebel soldiers in the town of Zabadani, near the Lebanese
 border.

 Rebel soldiers who identified themselves as members of the Free Syrian Army and a Zabadani activist said loyalist

 soldiers retreated Wednesday afternoon, five days after launching an offensive to quell dissent in Zabadani. The
 mountain resort 20 miles north of Damascus is one of as many as three dozen places in Syria that the opposition says

 have slipped beyond government control in recent weeks.

 Offensives by Damascus have ebbed and flowed throughout the 10-month-old uprising, and the rebels acknowledged

Netanyahu into land-for-peace concessions. "The idea that the President can propose a
US map [regarding Israeli withdrawal fromthe West Bank] for a country he does not know
is a disaster," Gingrich said. Then he complained, "The Clinton administration has not held

[Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser] Arafat's feet to the fire."
But, by October 1998, Netanyahu had all but caved to Clinton's pressure. The man who
once mocked "advocates ofcapitulation" now clasped hands with Arafat after a protracted
conference at Wye, Maryland. Netanyahu agreed to redeploy Israeli troops from 13

percent of the West Bank, including most of Hebron. His sudden turnabout cost himkey
support inside Likud, provoking a Knesset vote for early elections. His right-wing base
shattered, paving the path for a decisive victory for the Labor Party's Ehud Barak, a former
Israeli general favored and quietly supported by the Clinton administration.

Suddenly in the wilderness, Netanyahu plotted his path back by cultivating the right-wing
in the US — the pundits, the Republican politicians, the big donors, Fox News. In 2007, he
held a meeting with a small group of conservative activists emerging as key players in the
conservative blogosphere. Among those present was Andrew Breitbart, who became a
notorious hatchet man staging wild stunts and whose myriad websites routinely carry

conspiratorial, racially charged attacks on Obama. Other figures at the meeting included
conservative bloggers Scott Johnson, JimHolt and Jeff Emmanuel. "At our meeting we
talked mostly about the dangers of the Iranian regime acquiring a nuclear bomb," Johnson
recalled, revealing his newly acquired foreign policy expertise. "It was a subject to which
Netanyahu had obviously devoted great thought."

Two years later, Netanyahu returned to the Prime Minister's office at the head of an even
more decidedly right-wing coalition than before government and was determined not to
repeat his previous mistakes of "capitulating" to the peace process at the behest of an
American president. Now he turned to the movement he had courted to help him
undermine and humiliate Obama.

Humiliating Obama
 In March 2010, when Obama dispatched Vice President Joseph Biden to Israel in a futile
attempt to restart negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Netanyahu
 appeared in Jerusalem at a massive rally of 1,000 evangelicals organized by Texas mega-
church Pastor John Hagee, a leading Christian Zionist and sometime Holocaust revisionist

whose End Times theology committed him to the vision of Greater Israel. Seated onstage
 beside Netanyahu was Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren (a
 neoconservative former Shalem Center fellow), and Deputy Foreign Minister Danny
Ayalon, who had just snubbed a visiting delegation of leading Democratic members of
 Congress. Before the rapture-ready audience, Netanyahu proclaimed that Jerusalem

 would remain "the undivided, eternal capital of the Jewish people."
 At once, he authorized the construction of 1,600 new settlement units in occupied East
 Jerusalemover the stringent objections fromthe Obama administration. Though the move
 angered the White House, Ron Dermer, a top Netanyahu aide with close ties to leading
 Republicans in Washington, reassured the Prime Minister that Republicans would retake

 Congress. Netanyahu simply rejected Obama's plea to freeze settlements and then
 rejected overtures to restart the peace process. In the 2010 mid-term elections,
 Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives.
 While on a trip to New York days after the Republican victory, Netanyahu authorized
 another 1,000 more settlement units in East Jerusalem, a direct rebuke of Obama. That

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793503 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

same day, Netanyahu held a meeting with the incoming House Majority Leader Eric

Cantor, the only Jewish Republican in Congress, and a leader of the right-wing in the
House Republican Conference. Cantor's office produced a summary of the meeting for the
media that contained the remarkably crude statement: Cantor promised Netanyahu that
"the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the [Obama] Administration and
what has been, up until this point, one party rule in Washington."

In April 2011, Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner personally invited
Netanyahu to speak before a joint session of Congress. He was interrupted 36 times by
standing ovations – more than Obama during his State of the Union address – despite
making such mind-boggling false claims as that the "vast majority" of Israeli settlers live in

"neighborhoods in Jerusalemand greater Tel Aviv."
With a rancorous, multi-billion dollar US presidential campaign certainly looming on the
horizon, Netanyahu continued his pattern of making friends in the radical right's media
machine. Among them was Glenn Beck, a Mormon convert and former Fox News host,

who had compared a major liberal Jewish religious denomination to radical Islamists and
claimed that Obama has "a deep-seated hatred for white people." Beck was admonished
by the Anti-Defamation League and other mainstreamJewish groups for his anti-Semitic
rants against George Soros, a major funder of liberal and Democratic Party-related
organizations. In July 2011, Beck traveled to Israel to deliver a diatribe against liberal

Israelis demonstrating against Netanyahu's economic policies, labeling thempatsies in a
secret Islamist-Communist plot.
When the right-wing Zionist Organization of America honored Beck this November with a
prize named after Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, Netanyahu displayed his •

gratitude in a videotaped tribute. "Glenn, you can be sure that if Sheldon and Miri Adelson
put their name to something, it must stand for a lot. You stand for a lot... And I want to tell
you howdeeply we appreciate this stand of courage and integrity."
Dear Sasha
In December, Thomas Friedman, the Pulitzer Prize winning     New York Times' former

JerusalemBureau Chief and one of the few American columnists whose opinions
seriously register in the Israeli media, published an uncharacteristically pointed critique of
Netanyahu's leadership. In Friedman's column were two lines that incited the wrath and
fury of the Prime Minister's office. "I sure hope that Israel's prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, understands that the standing ovation he got in Congress this year was not for

his politics. That ovation was bought and paid for by the Israel lobby."
Neoconservative opinion makers exploded with orchestrated rage accusing Friedman of
being a self-hating Jewish anti-Semite. In response, theNew York Times gave Netanyahu
an opportunity to respond on its opinion page.

But rather than accept theTimes' offer, Netanyahu dispatched Ron Dermer, his key
emissary to the American political scene, especially to the conservative movement, now
serving as a senior advisor on his staff, to issue what amounted to a declaration of war
against the American newspaper of record. Dermer's letter was extraordinary in its
vitriolic, hostile and contemptuous tone. Nothing like it had ever existed before —a vicious

official attack fromthe Prime Minister of Israel on the credibility of theNew York Times.
Perhaps only a little less surprising was that this major event received nearly no coverage
in the American press.

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793503 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

In his scathing letter, Dermer accused theTimes   of "cavalierly defam[ing] our country,"
claiming that 19 out of 20 op-eds published in theTimes   were "negative" (Dermer did not
challenge their factual basis). He concluded, "it would seem as if the surest way to get an
op-ed published in the New York Times these days, no matter how obscure the writer or
the viewpoint, is to attack Israel."

One of the remarkable aspects of Dermer's letter was that it was addressed, "Dear
Sasha." Who is Sasha? Sasha Polakow-Suransky, a staff editor at the     Times editorial
page, is in charge of assigning pieces on foreign policy. Why did Dermer address his letter
to Polakow-Suransky instead of to Andrew Rosenthal, the director of the    Times editorial
page? Was he singling out Polakow-Suransky because he revealed in his 2010 book,        The
Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Relationship With Apartheid South Africa,   that Israel
offered to sell nuclear warheads to South Africa's apartheid government, a bombshell

revelation that prompted furious denials from Israeli President Shimon Peres and Deputy
Prime Minister Dan Meridor, embarrassing a country that still refuses to discuss its nuclear
program in any public forums, and punishes those who do?
Netanyahu's attack on the  Times represented a significant new stage in his shadow war.
He was drawing sharp new lines. By rebuking the paper, Netanyahu attempted to define
its liberal Zionist, pro-peace process editorial line as hostile to Israeli security needs. And
by default, he positioned Rupert Murdoch's   Wall Street Journal, with its relentlessly anti-
Obama, pro-Bibi op-ed page, as the only respectable forum for true friends of Israel.
Bibi's man in Washington

More than any other candidate in the Republican presidential contest, Newt Gingrich has
hewed to Netanyahu's line on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In an interview with the cable
TV Jewish Channel, Gingrich declared "We've had an invented Palestinian people who
are in fact Arabs and are historically part of the Arab community and they had a chance to
go many places." He added "I see myself as, in many ways, to be pretty close to Bibi
Netanyahu in thinking about the dangers of the world."
In May 2010, when Gingrich's presidential campaign was no more than the subject of
guarded speculation, Israel Hayom,   Bibi's house organ, provided Gingrich with a Hebrew-

language forum to assail Obama's policies. The tabloid splashed a full page photo of a
smiling Gingrich on its front page accompanied by the caption: "The former Chairman of
the House of Representatives attacks the blindness of the Western Elites: 'Evading the
confrontation with Evil may bring a second Holocaust, the mistakes made by the White
House will exact a terrible price."
Israel Hayom's  owner, Las Vegas Sands casino corporation chairman Sheldon Adelson, is
America's eighth wealthiest man. At the same time he was bankrolling Netanyahu's
career, Adelson also became Gingrich's leading financial angel. The casino kingpin was

introduced to Gingrich in 1996 through George Harris, a right-wing anti-tax activist and
Clark County, Nevada Republican chairman who helped Adelson block a unionization bid
at one of his casinos. Gingrich resigned from Congress in disgrace in 1999, forced out by
Republicans, hiding his extramarital affair with a congressional staffer. Adelson stepped in
as his financial godfather, pumping millions into the coffers of American Solutions for
Winning the Future, an independent political committee that covered Gingrich's
extravagant travel expenses.
When Gingrich embarked on the presidential trail, George Harris became his campaign

finance co-chair, representing Adelson by proxy. (Adelson's Sands corporation is currently

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793503 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

facing a federal criminal probe for allegedly bribing foreign officials). And when Gingrich
provoked a hailstormof criticismfor claiming the Palestinians were "invented," Adelson

publicly defended him. "Read the history of those who call themselves Palestinians, and
you will hear why [Newt] Gingrich said recently that the Palestinians are an invented
people," Adelson told a group of American Jews visiting Israel on a programhe funds,
Taglit-Birthright Israel.
Despite Gingrich's dismal finish in the Iowa caucuses, the opening contest in the

Republican contest, Adelson has staunchly remained on his side, donating US$5 million to
a Super PAC created to support Gingrich's campaign in the key primary state of South
Carolina, his Armageddon.
Bibi's Super PAC

When Gingrich quits the race, Netanyahu will not be without a candidate. He can count on
former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney to carry the neoconservative banner all the
way to Election Day. Of Romney's 22 campaign foreign policy advisers, 15 worked in the
administration of George WBush, and six were original members of the Project for the
New American Century, the neoconservative group that called for regime change in Iraq.

Romney's own Super PAC, Restore Our Future, credited with destroying Gingrich's hopes
in Iowa through a relentless barrage of negative ads, is financed in part by Mel Sembler, a
Florida-based a multi-millionaire shopping mall developer and veteran Republican
fundraiser, appointed the US ambassador to Italy by President George W Bush. Sembler
was mired in scandal when the federal government revoked the license of a chain of

adolescent treatment centers he founded after former teenage patients complained they
were sexually abused, psychologically tortured and humiliated during sadistic behavior
modification programs. Less well known is the financial largesse Sembler has bestowed
on neoconservative outfits supporting Netanyahu's policies. He is also a close friend of
Adelson.

In November 2011, President Obama and French President Nicolas Sarkozy
commiserated about Netanyahu, unaware that their voices were picked up by a live
microphone. "You're fed up with him, but I have to deal with himeven more often than
you," Obama complained to Sarkozy. Romney seized on the episode as proof of Obama's
disqualifying leadership and proof of his own fitness for office. "We have here yet another

reason why we need new leadership in the White House," Romney declared. (Joining the
chorus of pro-Bibi attacks on Obama were the Netanyahu-approved bloggers Breitbart
Hoft and Johnson).
 In ramping up the effort to turn Israel into an anti-Obama wedge issue, a group of
neoconservative Netanyahu allies have started a independent political committee called

the Emergency Committee for Israel (ECI). The group's name was inspired by the
Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People of Europe, an organization that
 Netanyahu's father, Benzion, helped lead during World War II in part to raise money for
the right-wing Irgun militia in Palestine. The group's board comprises a Who's Who of
Washington neoconservatives. It is directed by Noah Pollak, a former assistant editor of

Azure,  the in-house journal of the Adelson-funded Shalem Center, several of whose
fellows are now in Netanyahu's inner circle of advisers. Pollak was credited with helping
 the Israeli army launch a YouTube channel to rebut accusations that it committed war
 crimes in the Gaza Strip and elsewhere.

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793503 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

This month, the ECI established a Super PAC in order to use unlimited corporate
contributions for political attack ads. The group's first major presidential campaign ad buy

targeted Representative Ron Paul (R-Texas), a fervently anti-war libertarian candidate
who has called for an end to the special relationship between Israel and the United States.
Scheduled to air in the key primary state of South Carolina, where the Republican
electorate is dominated by right-wing evangelicals, the ad features Gary Bauer, an ECI
board member, Christian right leader and failed presidential candidate staring into the

camera, warning that "Ron Paul's conservatismis isolationist and conspiratorial." (Bauer
endorsed former Senator Rick Santorum, a right-wing Catholic, who has declared, "All the
people that live in the West Bank are Israelis. They are not Palestinians. There is no
Palestinian. This is Israeli land.")

Jewish concerns
While Obama and the Democratic Party elite have kept silent in the face of Netanyahu's
American shadow war, its polarizing effects have prompted resistance froman
unexpected place: the Jewish-American establishment. Weeks of Republican attacks on
Obama for his supposed molly-coddling of Israel enemies caused deep discomfort in the

offices of mainstreamJewish groups, which have lobbied for decades to consolidate
support for Israel in both major American political parties. With Israel deliberately being
shaped into a campaign wedge issue, some Jewish leaders worried that rank-and-file
Democratic voters would begin to sour on the US-Israel special relationship.
In October, two of the US's oldest and most prominent Jewish organizations, the Anti-

Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee, released a "National Pledge for
Unity" urging politicians, religious leaders and other Jewish groups aimed at preserving   .
bipartisan support for Israel. "We want the discourse on US support for Israel to avoid the
sometimes polarizing debates and political attacks that have emerged in recent weeks, as
candidates have challenged their opponents' pro-Israel bone fides or questioned the

current administration's foreign policy approach vis-a-vis Israel," declared Anti-Defamation
League national director Abraham Foxman. "The last thing America and Israel need right
nowis the distractions of having Israel bandied about as a tool for waging political
attacks."
The Emergency Committee for Israel and the Republican Jewish Coalition, an Adelson-

funded pro-Netanyahu group that claims to raise "tens of millions" of dollars for
Republican candidates each election cycle, not only rejected the unity pledge, but
accused its authors of attempting to suppress pro-Israel activism. In a defiant statement
by its chairman, neoconservative activist WilliamKristol, the ECI proclaimed, "This attempt
to silence those of us who have 'questioned the current administration's foreign policy

approach vis-a-vis Israel' will re-energize us." Thus the show went on. The effort to lower
the temperature only became another occasion for the pro-Netanyahu operation to raise
the heat. As their anti-Obama campaign intensifies, Israel is being merged seamlessly
with traditional right-wing wedge issues such as abortion, gay marriage and the menace of
immigration.

The deepening wedge
In his writings and in the company of his inner circle, Netanyahu has expressed almost as
 much disdain for liberal Jewish supporters of Israel as he has for the professed enemies
 of the Jewish state. His book, A Durable Peace,   is filled with attacks on Israeli advocates
 of a negotiated peace with the Palestinians, accusing themof "cloying sentimentalism"

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793503 Date: 11/30/2015</span>

and falling victimto the "relentless Jewish desire to see an end to struggle." Netanyahu

was said to privately fume about Obama's Jewish senior advisor, David Axelrod, and his
then-Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, an ardent liberal Zionist whose father was born and
raised in Israel. Netanyahu reportedly called them"self-hating Jews."
After two decades of cultivating the culture warriors of the American right as allies against

those seeking "an end to struggle," Netanyahu is beginning to see results. He initiated and
propelled a polarization process that has enabled Republicans to use Israel as a cudgel
for attacking their opponents, and did so over the objections of powerful mainstream
Jewish-American interests. HaimMalka, a senior fellow for the center-right Washington-
based Center for Strategic and International Studies, predicted in a recent paper: "The

partisan wedge is likely to deepen, posing considerable challenges to Israel and the US-
Israeli partnership."
In the past, America's Israel lobby sold the US-Israel alliance as a marriage of two vibrant
democracies united by shared liberal values. In the current environment of heightened

polarization, the special relationship is increasingly marketed to Americans as a united
front of besieged bastions of Western civilization against an incipient Islamic onslaught.
Rapture ready evangelicals, right-wing ultra-nationalists, and Republican Jews are far
more likely to be attracted to this sort of alliance than cosmopolitan liberals. And this may

be exactly the way Netanyahu wants it.
But he is far fromconfident that he can dislodge Obama. Steeling himself for a possible
second Obama term, Netanyahu has signaled his intention to move up the date of Israel's
national election. Hanan Krystal, a political analyst for Israel Radio, explained Netanyahu's
possible motives to Reuters: "At the highest echelons, they have long been saying that if

Obama is elected for a second term, the carrot will be replaced by a stick."

</span>

(AFP) - The Middle East peacemaking Quartet, which meets on Monday in Washington, must take "decisive
action" to restart peace talks, a senior Palestinian official said.

In a statement issued ahead of the meeting of representatives from the United States, United Nations, European
Union and Russia, Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi urged the Quartet to "undertake its responsibilities
seriously."

The group is expected to discuss   ways to  restart stalled peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, in a bid
to head off Palestinian attempts to seek membership at the United Nations in September.

The Palestinians have said they will not be deterred from seeking UNmembership, bUt that they remain open to
new talks if they are based on clear guidelines and Israel stops Jewish settlement construction during
negotiations.

"It is clear that if there is to be any genuine political momentum and progress, then the Quartet has to undertake
its responsibilities seriously," said Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.

She called on the group to commit to clear guidelines and a timeframe for any new talks, and to "effectively

bring Israel to compliance, including a cessation of all settlement activities."

Talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down shortly after they restarted in September 2010 when Israel

declined to renew a partial freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank.

The Palestinians have accused Washington of failing to insist on a new moratorium and weakening the Quartet's
position on settlement construction, which much of the international community regards as illegal.

"The United States must not again undermine its own standing and prospects for peace by diluting the Quartet's
political position or preventing positive engagement on the part of the international community," Ashrawi said.

"The Quartet must exhibit the political will to translate words into action. Until this happens there will be no
change to the current status quo."

Utah Governor to Become Ambassador to China

By Jeff Zeleny

Updated
          President Obama on Saturday selected one of the nation's leading Republican governors to serve as
the ambassador to China, nominating Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman for the diplomatic post that Mr. Obama called
"as important as any in the world."

"We will launch a new era of partnership between our two nations that will advance our shared dreams of

opportunity and security in America, in Asia and around the world," Mr. Obama said. "I can think of no more
important assignment than creating the kinds of bridges between our two countries that will determine the well
being not just of Americans and Chinese, but also the future of the world."

In a morning announcement at the White House, Mr. Huntsman stood at the president's side in the Diplomatic
Room and accepted the position that he said came as a surprise. As a co-chairman of Senator John McCain's
presidential campaign last year, Mr. Huntsman said he did not expect to be "called into action by the person
who beat us."

Mr. Huntsman, 49, learned to speak Mandarin Chinese from his days as a Mormon missionary in Taiwan. He
has worked in two Bush administrations, serving as the ambassador to Singapore in the final year of George
H.W. Bush's term and as a deputy United States trade ambassador for George W. Bush.

For Mr. Obama, whose advisers already have their eyes set on his re-election in 2012, the selection of Mr.
Huntsman is something of a political coup. He has emerged as one of the nation's most visible Republican
governors and was expected to at least consider seeking his party's presidential nomination to run against Mr.
Obama.

"In the breadth of issues at stake, this ambassadorship is as important as any in the world," Mr. Obama said. "I
believe there is much to be gained from a closer working relationship with China, but improved relationships
will require candor on issues in which we don't always agree."

As the Republican Party forges through a period of reinvention, Mr. Huntsman has been a leading voice for the
direction of the party. He has been a political moderate on issues like immigration, gay rights and the
environment, even though he represented one of the most conservative states in the country.

       <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762241 Date: 06/30/2015</span>

It was far from certain whether Mr. Huntsman would have actually sought the Republican presidential
nomination —his centrist views could have created a challenge in early-voting states —but if he is confirmed by
the Senate for the ambassadorship to China, he is part of the Obama team at a time when China is of critical
importance. And he is out of the mix in the 2012 presidential race.

"When the president of the United States asks you to step up and serve in a capacity like this, that to me is the
end of the conversation and the beginning of the obligation to rise to the challenge," said Mr. Huntsman, who
was joined by his wife Mary Kaye, and the couple's seven children, one of whom was adopted from China.

The courtship of Mr. Huntsman was overseen by the White House Chief of Staff, Ralun Emanuel, who met with

him last Saturday when the governor was in town for the White House Correspondent's dinner. Mr. Obama also
spoke to Mr. Huntsman, aides said, and was impressed by his experience and views on China.

"Governor Huntsman has respect for China's proud traditions," Mr. Obama said Saturday. "He understands

what it will take to make America more competitive in the 21st century and will be an unstinting advocate for
America's interests and ideals."

The nomination of Mr. Huntsman is the latest in a series of high-level Republican appointments in the Obama
administration. The president selected two Republicans to serve in his Cabinet, but aides said he was frustrated
when a third choice, Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, withdrew his nomination as

Commerce Secretary.

Mr. Huntsman, who was elected to his second term of governor last year, intends to step down if he is
confirmed by the Senate.

"I hope the good people of Utah will forgive me and understand how proud they should be of their governor for
his willingness to serve," Mr. Obama said. "He always puts country ahead of himself. That's what Jon has
always done."

  Re: US mentor to Egyptian revolutionaries

  The New York Times today discloses that youthful non-violent Egyptian revolutionaries have
  been inspired by the work of an American political thinker on non-violent resistance, Gene
  Sharp, who spent decades at Harvard. (See NYT article and bio of Sharp below.)

  You might consider inviting him to see you and then sending him on a State Department USIS
  tour.

  NYT:

  Breaking free from older veterans of the Arab political opposition, they relied on tactics of

  nonviolent resistance channeled from an American scholar through a Serbian youth brigade -
  but also on marketing tactics borrowed from Silicon Valley.

  For their part, Mr. Maher and his colleagues began reading about nonviolent struggles. They
  were especially drawn to a Serbian youth movement called Otpor, which had helped topple the
  dictator Slobodan Milosevic by drawing on the ideas of an American political thinker, Gene
  Sharp. The hallmark of Mr. Sharp's work is well-tailored to Mr. Mubark's Egypt: He argues that
  nonviolence is a singularly effective way to undermine police states that might cite violent

  resistance to justift repression in the name of stability.

  Dual Uprisings Show Potent New Threats to

  Arab States

  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and DAVID E. SANGER

  CAIRO — As protesters in Tahrir Square faced off against pro-government forces, they drew a
  lesson from their counterparts in Tunisia: "Advice to the youth of Egypt: Put vinegar or onion
  under your scarf for tear gas."

  The exchange on Facebook was part of a remarkable two-year collaboration that has given birth

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05789099 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

   In Washington that day, President Obama turned up, unexpectedly, at a 3:30 p.m. Situation
   Room meeting of his "principals," the key members of the national security team, where he

   displaced Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, from his seat at the head of the table.

   The White House had been debating the likelihood of a domino effect since youth-driven revolts
   had toppled President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia, even though the American intelligence
   community and Israel's intelligence services had estimated that the risk to President Mubarak
   was low — less than 20 percent, some officials said.

   According to senior officials who participated in Mr. Obama's policy debates, the president took
   a different view. He made the point early on, a senior official said, that "this was a trend" that
   could spread to other authoritarian governments in the region, including in Iran. By the end of
   the 18-day uprising, by a White House count, there were 38 meetings with the president about
   Egypt. Mr. Obama said that this was a chance to create an alternative to "the Al Qaeda narrative"

   of Western interference.

   American officials had seen no evidence of overtly anti-American or anti-Western sentiment.
   "When we saw people bringing their children to Tahrir Square, wanting to see history being
   made, we knew this was something different," one official said.

   On Jan. 28, the debate quickly turned to how to pressure Mr. Mubarak in private and in public -
   and whether Mr. Obama should appear on television urging change. Mr. Obama decided to call
   Mr. Mubarak, and several aides listened in on the line. Mr. Obama did not suggest that the 82-
   year-old leader step aside or transfer power. At this point, "the argument was that he really
   needed to do the reforms, and do them fast," a senior official said. Mr. Mubarak resisted, saying
   the protests were about outside interference.

   According to the official, Mr. Obama told him, "You have a large portion of your people who are
   not satisfied, and they won't be until you make concrete political, social and economic reforms."

   The next day, the decision was made to send former Ambassador Frank G. Wisner to Cairo as an
   envoy. Mr. Obama began placing calls to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Prime

   Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and other regional leaders.

   The most difficult calls, officials said, were with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Mr.
   Netanyahu, who feared regional instability and urged the United States to stick with Mr.
   Mubarak. According to American officials, senior members of the government in Saudi Arabia
   argued that the United States should back Mr. Mubarak even if he used force against the
   demonstrators. By Feb. 1, when Mr. Mubarak broadcast a speech pledging that he would not run

   again and that elections would be held in September, Mr. Obama concluded that the Egyptian
   president still had not gotten the message.

   Within an hour, Mr. Obama called Mr. Mubarak again in the toughest, and last, of their
   conversations. "He said if this transition process drags out for months, the protests will, too," one
   of Mr. Obama's aides said.

   Mr. Mubarak told Mr. Obama that the protests would be over in a few days.

   Mr. Obama ended the call, the official said, with these words: "I respect my elders. And you
   have been in politics for a very long time, Mr. President. But there are moments in history when
   just because things were the same way in the past doesn't mean they will be that way in the

   future."

   The next day, heedless of Mr. Obama's admonitions, Mr. Mubarak launched another attack

REF: A. STATE 86734
      B. STATE 82581

1 . (SBU) This is an action request, see paras 4 - 6.

2 . (SBU) On August 14, the USG and Colombian government
provisionally agreed ad referendum to the text of a
bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) (septel).
We expect the final agreement may be signed in Bogota in
about a month, following a final review by both sides. As

noted in reftels, the DCA would permit the United States
access to several Colombian military bases and facilitate
effective bilateral cooperation on security matters in
Colombia. It would not/not authorize establishment of any
U.S. bases or ports, nor would it result in an overall
increase in the number of U.S. military personnel or
 U.S.-citizen civilian contractors in Colombia.

 3 .(SBU) On August 18, the Secretary and Colombian FM
 Jaime Bermudez met in Washington to discuss the DCA,
including the importance of coordinating our public
 affairs and diplomatic strategies (septel to follow).
 There is some concern that the upcoming Union of South

 American Nations (UNASUR) summit would become a regional
 referendum on the DCA. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe

will attend the summit provided that a full range of
regional security matters can be discussed, not just the
DCA. In this context, we are reaching out to selected

UNASUR members to ask that they raise other regional
security issues beyond the DCA.

4 . (SBU) Action requested for Santiago, Asuncion, and
Lima: that you find an opportunity prior to the August 28
summit to raise the importance of discussing the full

range of regional security topics during the summit, and
not merely the DCA, with appropriate high levels of host
government.

5 . (SBU) Action requested for all: that Ambassadors to
UNASUR member states deliver the attached letter from the
Secretary to host governments in advance of the August 2,8

summit.

6 . (U) Begin text:

Dear Madam/Mr. Minister:

I wanted to take a moment to write to you and your

colleagues about the upcoming summit of the Union of South
American Nations (UNASUR), scheduled for August 28 in
Bariloche. UNASUR provides an important forum to address
the issues and challenges that affect the region. The
United States supports the formation and effective
functioning of regional groups such as UNASUR. They
promote stability, cohesion, and leadership on key issues,

and ensure the best possible communication between
nations.

As you know, our common neighbor,
Colombia, has faced an ongoing threat from an unholy
alliance of terrorist groups funded by the insidious
illegal narcotics trade. These terrorists have threatened

the security of average Colombians and sought to overthrow
by violence and corruption successive,
democratically-elected Colombian governments. The actions
of these groups also threaten the security of other
countries in the hemisphere, sometimes directly, in many
ways indirectly. Over the last decade, Colombians have

beat back this threat, to the benefit of us all. My
country is proud of the role we have been able to play in
this effort.

This battle is far from won. Our governments and people
are collectively forced to find ways to protect ourselves
and our institutions from such threats. I am certain

these very issues will be addressed at the upcoming
summit, including the recently concluded Defense
Cooperation Agreement (DCA) . We understand the

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764569 Date: 07/31/2015</span>

sensitivities associated with U.S. military activities in
the hemisphere and the questions your government may have

regarding the scope and extent of this agreement. I hope
the efforts made in the last few weeks by both my
government and the Colombian government have helped
address those questions.

I would like to take this opportunity to make several key

points about the DCA. First, this agreement is a
bilateral agreement with Colombia to deepen our
cooperation on security challenges within Colombia,
permitting U.S. access to specified agreed Colombian
facilities to undertake mutually agreed activities on
Colombian territory. It is a bilateral agreement that
does not pose any threat or risk for the citizens of other

nations. On the contrary, our mutual efforts to combat
drug trafficking benefit the security of the region as a
whole. The agreement does not permit the establishment of
U.S. bases in Colombia. It will not result in an increase
in the U.S. military presence in Colombia, and we do not
seek any such increase. Activities undertaken at or from

Colombian bases by U.S. persons will be coordinated in
advance by Colombian authorities. All activities will be
based on full respect for the principles of sovereignty,
territorial integrity of states, and
non-interventionism.

We are committed to being as forthcoming as possible in

addressing concerns about this bilateral agreement with
nations in the region, and we have endeavored to do so in
recent weeks through a variety of mechanisms. As concerns
or questions arise, I hope that you will feel free to
reach out to us to seek clarification.

The UNASUR summit provides a unique opportunity for the

organization to address a range of security issues that
affect the hemisphere, and I salute your leadership for
deciding to discuss these matters. The security
challenges affecting our hemisphere, and your nations in
 particular, are pressing and grave. Our firm belief is
that a collective and collaborative approach to these
 matters is essential. It is our commitment to work with

 UNASUR nations to help address these concerns.

 Sincerely yours,

 Hillary Rodham Clinton

  Re: Q's secret bid to UK
</span>

  On the morning of June 2, 2011 sensitive sources with access to the advisors to Muammar
  Qaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, stated in strict confidence that the Libyan government has opened
  extremely complicated negotiations with the government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an

  effort to obtain their support in reaching a ceasefire agreement with the rebels of the Libyan
  Transitional National Council (TNC), allowing the Qaddafi's to maintain some level of control
  in the country.

  This initiative is directed by Saif al-Islam and, according to these sensitive sources, the Libyans
  have asked the UK officials to broker a deal with the TNC that will allow some form of power
  sharing, with the possibility of Saif al-Islam acting as head of state and the TNC members

  making up a substantial portion of the cabinet in a new government. Under the plan Muammar
  Qaddafi would be allowed to leave the country and go into exile with no danger of indictment on
  charges of human rights abuses and corruption by Libyan or international courts.

  (Source Comment: In the opinion of these sensitive sources, this initiative reflects the concern of
  the Qaddafi government that as a result of continuing NATO air raids against their forces, they
  can no longer defeat the rebel army. They add that there has been no firm response from the UK
  government, and the initial discussions have been conducted by officers of the British Special

  Intelligence Service (SIS / MI-6). In the opinion of these same sources the initial idea of these
  talks may have been raised by former Libyan Foreign Minister Mousa Kousa, after his arrival in
  London in late March 2011.)

  According to these sensitive sources, Saif al-Islam and his advisors realize that there is little
  chance the TNC will agree to such an offer, and that SIS may be using this contact as a means of
  collecting intelligence while protecting British interests in Libya. Notwithstanding this concern,

  in the opinion of these individuals, Saif al-Islam believes that introducing the possibility of a
  ceasefire and the subsequent negotiations may create divisions within NATO and weaken their
  military operations against Qaddafi's forces.

<span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780292 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

     (Source Comment: These sources add that many of Saif al-Islam's advisors do not know if, or to
     what extent, the UK Government has shared knowledge of this initiative with the governments of

     the United States and the other NATO allies.)

     At the same time, sources with access to the operations of the TNC military committee state
     privately that on June 1, 2011 Libyan intelligence officers detonated a car bomb outside the
     Tibesti Hotel in the TNC capital of Benghazi. One person was injured in the blast and a number

     of nearby vehicles were damaged. TNC security officers occupied the hotel and the surrounding
     area immediately after the attack, but were not able to identify any of the attackers. The Tibesti
     Hotel is an important landmark in the heart of Benghazi and is used by the TNC government, as
     well by foreign journalists and diplomats. Hotel security has been heightened in the hours

     following the attack and all foreign residents are under surveillance by TNC security officers,
     looking for suspicious activities and contacts.

</span>

SEOUL (NY Times) - The United States Navy intercepted a North Korean ship it suspected of carrying missile

technology to Myanmar two weeks ago and, after a standoff at sea and several days of diplomatic pressure from
Washington and Asia nations, forced the vessel to return home, according to several senior American officials.

Washington made no announcement about the operation, which paralleled a similar, far more public

confrontation with North Korea two years ago. But in response to questions about what appears to be a growing
trade in missiles and missile parts between North Korea and Myanmar — two of the world's most isolated
governments -- American officials have described the episode as an example of how they can use a
combination of naval power and diplomatic pressure to enforce United Nations sanctions imposed after the
North's last nuclear test, in 2009.

It was a rare victory: a similar shipment of suspected missile parts made it to Myanmar last year before
American officials could act. Despite the Obama administration's efforts to squeeze North Korea with both
economic and trade sanctions, there are continuing reports of sophisticated missile technology exchanges, some

of it by air, between North Korea and Iran, among other nations.

North Korea, aware that shipments leaving the country are under increased scrutiny, has found a profitable
trading partner in the authoritarian government in Myanmar.

The extent of that trade is unclear to American intelligence agencies. Two years ago, Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton publicly expressed suspicions that Myanmar was attempting to purchase nuclear weapons
 technology, but it recently said it was too poor to use such technology. And the evidence has been scant at best.

(In 2009, India inspected a North Korean ship that was believed to be carrying equipment for a nuclear reactor
 to Myanmar, but quickly discovered that its contents were legal.)

 The most recent episode began after American officials tracked a North Korean cargo ship, the MN Light, that
 was believed to have been involved in previous illegal shipments. Suspecting that it   was carrying missile

 components, they dispatched a Navy vessel, the destroyer McCampbell, to track it.

 "This case had an interesting wrinkle: the ship was North Korean, but it was flagged in Belize," one American
 official said, meaning it was registered in that Central American nation, perhaps to throw off investigators.

 But Belize is a member of the Proliferation Security Initiative, an effort begun by President George W. Bush's
 administration to sign up countries around the world to interdict suspected unconventional weapons. It is an

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05780774 Date: 01/07/2016</span>

effort that, like the military and C.I.A. drone programs, Mr. Obama has adopted, and one of the rare areas where
he has praised his predecessor.

According to American officials, the authorities in Belize gave permission to the United States to inspect the
ship.

On May 26, somewhere south of Shanghai, the McCampbell caught up with the cargo ship and hailed it, asking
to board the vessel under the authority given by Belize. Four times, the North Koreans refused.

As in the 2009 case, which involved the North Korean vessel the Kong Nam 1, the White House was unwilling
to forcibly board the ship in international waters, fearing a possible firelight and, in the words of one official, a

spark "that could ignite the Korean peninsula." Moreover, the Americans did not have definitive proof of what
was in the containers — and a mistake would have been embarrassing.

"There is always a chance that the North is setting us up for a raid that they know will find nothing," one

official said. "So we want to make sure we don't fall into a trap."

By happenstance, a group of senior officials from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — including a
representative from Myanmar — was in Washington while the slow-speed chase was occurring 8,000 miles
away. On May 27, when the group visited the Old Executive Office Building opposite the White House, Gary

Samore, the president's top nuclear adviser, addressed the officials, urging Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and
Malaysia to fully join the nonproliferation effort.

He then surprised the Asian officials by telling them he had a "sensitive subject" to raise, and described the
American suspicions, providing the group with a picture of the ship on its way to Myanmar. He reminded them

that under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874, which was passed in response to the North Korean
nuclear test in 2009, its vessels are to be inspected if "reasonable grounds" exist to suspect that weapons are
being exported.

"The Burmese official in the room protested that we were making accusations," said one American official

familiar with the exchange. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has denied stockpiling missiles or buying
parts from North Korea. It repeated those denials during recent visits to the country by a midlevel State
Department official and by Senator John McCain.

American officials dismiss those denials, pointing to years of evidence of missile-related purchases during both

the Bush and Obama administrations. But they concede they are mystified about Myanmar's motives. The
missiles that they believed were aboard the MN Light have a range of about 350 miles, meaning they could hit
 parts of India, China, Thailand or Laos — all unlikely targets.

 The message apparently got across. A few days later, long before approaching Myanmar, the cargo ship stopped

 dead in the water. Then it turned back to its home port, tracked by American surveillance planes and satellites,
and suffering engine trouble along the way.

The Bibi Connection

By: Max Blumenthal
Published Thursday, January 12, 2012

The US presidential election campaign that kicked off January 3 with the Iowa caucuses
was the subject of a curious article attacking President Barack Obama in the mass
circulation Israeli daily newspaper, Israel Hayom.
"US President Barack Obama is 'naïve' and needs to face up to the threat presented by

the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood across the Middle East, Israel's National Security
Council concluded during a strategic discussion several days ago,"   Israel Hayom reported.
The Israeli National Security Council consists of Benjamin "Bibi" Netanyahu's closest
advisers. And Israel Hayom   is not just another right-leaning Israeli tabloid. Referred to by
Israelis as the "Bibiton," or Bibi's mouthpiece, the paper is an instrument that gives him

extraordinary political leverage. The obviously planted article iIsrael Hayom  rang like a
bell sounding the start of Netanyahu's own campaign in helping the Republican Party oust
Obama from the White House.
Israel Hayom's  genesis demonstrates the depth of Netanyahu's connections in

Republican circles. It was created by one of Netanyahu's top financial supporters, a Las
Vegas-based casino tycoon named Sheldon Adelson, who is also a major donor to the

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05788130 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

conservative wing of the Republican Party. Adelson's closest relationship is with former
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, a longtime ally of Netanyahu who has been running

a rancorous campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.
Netanyahu's less than subtle intervention has become an open issue in Israeli politics.
Opposition leader Tzipi Livni of the Kadima Party has criticized Netanyahu for damaging
the US-Israeli relationship. "Netanyahu spoke about consensus," Livni said in May, "and if
there is a consensus in Israel, it's that the relationship with the US is essential to Israel,

and a prime minister that harms the relationship with the US over something unsubstantial
is harming Israel's security and deterrence."
But Livni's warning has been ignored. Rather than hesitating, the prime minister and his
inner circle are moving full steamahead in their political shadow campaign whose ultimate

goal is to remove Obama. Bibi's war against Obama is unprecedented. While Israeli prime
ministers have tried to help incumbent presidents, none have ever waged a full-scale
campaign to overthrow them.
Netanyahu has engaged enthusiastic allies in the Republican Congress, led by House
Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and within the right-wing media. His neoconservative alliet in

Washington are launching a "Super PAC" to generate emotional attack ads against
Obama and any candidate that might be an obstacle to his policies. And his campaign has
even broadened into an attempt to discredit the  New York Times,    whose editorial page
and foreign policy columnists, Thomas Friedman and Roger Cohen, have been critical of
him

Netanyahu's shadow campaign is intended to be a factor in defeating Obama and electing
a Republican in his place. He opposed Obama's early demand to freeze settlements on
the West Bank as a precondition for reviving the peace process, a process since the Oslo
Accord that Netanyahu has attempted to stall or sabotage, despite his signing of the Wye
Agreement under pressure from President Clinton. Since his adamant stand against the

settlement freeze, Netanyahu has undermined every effort to engage the peace process.
He appears dead set on consolidating Greater Israel, or what many Israelis call "Judea
and Samaria," and has signaled a strong desire to attack Iran.
By all accounts, Netanyahu's personal chemistry with Obama is toxic. Obama bristles at
his belligerence. But Netanyahu's hostility has reaped rewards fromhim, having stopped

the peace process in its tracks. The latest effort by the Quartet seems doomed to failure.
And Netanyahu's rejectionism has put Obama on the defense. Most of the US Jewish
establishment has remained a bulwark for Bibi's policies. Obama, meanwhile, has been
forced to declare America's "unshakable bond" with Israel, even as Bibi thwarts Obama's
initiatives and attacks himin the Israeli press.

As political strategy, by tainting Obama as less than full-throated in support of Israel,
Netanyahu bolsters the Republican themes that the president "apologizes" for US power,
is weak on national security, and is an agent of "decline." By depicting Obama as "weak"
on Israel, Netanyahu's campaign excites right-wing Jews and evangelical Christians, who
overwhelmingly accept the biblical claims of the Jewish state's historical right to Greater

Israel, Judea and Samaria. Bibi's deepest attack line against Obama merges theology
withideology.
His campaign against Obama is a high-stakes gambit that will almost certainly color US-
Israeli relations well past Election Day. Already, Netanyahu has succeeded in polarizing
the political debate, as his agenda is singularly aligned with the Republican Party. Yet

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05788130 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

Bibi's short-termobjectives are rapidly turning the US-Israel relationship, at least under his
aegis, into a partisan issue, another litmus test of conservative ideology rather than

national interest.
The personal connection
Netanyahu's American orientation is partly rooted in his personal history. Raised in
suburban Philadelphia, his father, Benzion Netanyahu, was the former press secretary for
the godfather of right-wing revisionist Zionism, Zeev Jabotinsky. Benzion Netanyahu

(original name: Benzion Mileikowsky) spent his most consequential years in New York
raising money for Jabotinsky and the rightist lrgun militia in Palestine. When he returned
to Israel to launch a political career, the elder Netanyahu was rejected by Menachem
Begin, the Likud Party leader, who, as right wing as he was, considered himdangerously

extreme (Arabs are "an enemy by essence," the elder Netanyahu said recently). But the
son triumphed where his father failed, rising at first on his fluency in American political
culture, a frequent guest on ABC News' Nightline and other US broadcast news programs,
eventually winning' the chairmanship of the Likud Party in 1992.
The following year, Netanyahu published a political manifesto in the formof a memoir,    A

Durable Peace,   edited with a helping hand fromAmerican neoconservative Douglas Feith.
The book was tailored to the sensibilities of an American audience, particularly one with
conservative Republican tendencies. In a revealing passage, Netanyahu warned readers
that the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state could lead Latinos to establish a "second
Mexico" in the American Southwest: "These [Latinos] would demand not merely equality

before the law, or naturalization, or even Spanish as a first language," he wrote. "Instead
they would say that since they forma local majority in the territory [which was forcibly
taken from Mexico in the war of 1848], they deserve a state of their own."
In 1996, when Netanyahu launched an underdog bid for Prime Minister against the grand
old man of the Labor Party establishment, Shimon Peres, he contracted the services of

Arthur Finkelstein, a reclusive New York-based Republican political consultant. Finkelstein
was infamous for orchestrating a come-from-behind victory in 1992 for Jesse Helms, a
radical neo-Confederate senator from North Carolina, by race baiting Helms' black
opponent. Finkelstein earned a fortune working for anti-gay candidates like Helms, even
while planning to marry his long-termboyfriend.

Netanyahu's campaign against Peres was defined by Finkelstein's trademark slashing
tactics. Frightening imagery flooded Israeli airwaves. Among Netanyahu's most successful
Finkelstein-crafted attack lines was, "Peres will divide Jerusalem." Even the positive
slogans had a negative subtext. "Bibi is good for the Jews," hinted darkly at the de facto
coalition Peres had constructed with Arab-based political parties. Finkelstein's media

assault on Peres, with its suggestion that he and his assassinated predecessor, Yitzhak
Rabin, had stabbed Israel in the back, propelled his client to a narrow victory.
The new Prime Minister relied on a kitchen cabinet of advisers fromneoconservative think
tanks, especially the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the
Shalem Center. In 1996, two of these advisers, former Reagan administration Pentagon

officials, Richard Perle and Douglas Feith, produced a document for Institute for Advanced
Strategic and Political Studies, a once influential base of neocon activity, called "A Clean
Break." The paper advocated overthrowing Saddam Hussein and attacking Syria "as a
prelude to a redrawing of the map of the Middle East." (Feith was appointed a Defense

Department official in the George WBush administration and became a fervent defender

    <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05788130 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

of the Iraq invasion, leading the effort to fabricate evidence of SaddamHussein's
operational links with al-Qaeda. General Tommy Frank, who led the invasion, called Feith
"the r*king stupidest guy on the face of the earth.")

Backing down to Clinton
President Bill Clinton was, according to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee
(AIPAC)'s then-President Steve Grossman, "the most pro-Israeli [president] in America's
history" – and he was committed to fulfilling the Oslo Accords on his watch. He developed

an unusually close relationship with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, coming to see himas
something of a father figure. When Rabin was assassinated by a right-wing Orthodox
Jewish extremist, Peres briefly took over, but was soon defeated by Netanyahu. Clinton
demanded that Netanyahu begin to withdraw Israeli troops fromsmall portions of land in
the occupied West Bank. With pressure mounting, Netanyahu flung himself into the

American political wars.
In January 1998, at the beginning of the impeachment scandal, Netanyahu appeared at a
rally organized by Reverend Jerry Falwell, a right-wing evangelical. Christian icon, who
had produced an elaborate conspiracy video accusing Clinton of drug trafficking and
complicity in the murder of Vince Foster, his White House deputy legal counsel and old

friend, who had, in fact, committed suicide.
Standing beside Falwell before an audience of hundreds of evangelical activists and right-
wing Jews, Netanyahu vowed in his signature basso profondo voice never to "divide"
Jerusalem, and proclaimed that the "Jewish people" were being "vilified and scorned and
misrepresented." After the rally, Netanyahu shuttled between meetings with conservative

pundits and the broadcast studios of Fox News and right-wing Christian TV networks,
stirring up his support among America's most zealous opponents of the peace process.
The most prominent among Netanyahu's newfound conservative allies was then-House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, an instigator of the impeachment. That April, at a meeting of the
Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, Gingrich condemned Clinton's attempts to pressure

Netanyahu into land-for-peace concessions. "The idea that the President can propose a
US map [regarding Israeli withdrawal fromthe West Bank] for a country he does not know
is a disaster," Gingrich said. Then he complained, "The Clinton administration has not held
[Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser] Arafat's feet to the fire."
But, by October 1998, Netanyahu had all but caved to Clinton's pressure. The man who

once mocked "advocates of capitulation" nowclasped hands with Arafat after a protracted
conference at Wye, Maryland. Netanyahu agreed to redeploy Israeli troops from 13
percent of the West Bank, including most of Hebron. His sudden turnabout cost himkey
support inside Likud, provoking a Knesset vote for early elections. His right-wing base

shattered, paving the path for a decisive victory for the Labor Party's Ehud Barak, a former
Israeli general favored and quietly supported by the Clinton administration.
Suddenly in the wilderness, Netanyahu plotted his path back by cultivating the right-wing
in the US —the pundits, the Republican politicians, the big donors, Fox News. In 2007, he
held a meeting with a small group of conservative activists emerging as key players in the

conservative blogosphere. Among those present was Andrew Breitbart, who became a
notorious hatchet man staging wild stunts and whose myriad websites routinely carry
conspiratorial, racially charged attacks on Obama. Other figures at the meeting included
conservative bloggers Scott Johnson, JimHoft and Jeff Emmanuel. "At our meeting we
talked mostly about the dangers of the Iranian regime acquiring a nuclear bomb," Johnson

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05788130 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

recalled, revealing his newly acquired foreign policy expertise. "It was a subject to which
Netanyahu had obviously devoted great thought."
Two years later, Netanyahu returned to the Prime Minister's office at the head of an even

more decidedly right-wing coalition than before government and was determined not to
repeat his previous mistakes of "capitulating" to the peace process at the behest of an
American president. Now he turned to the movement he had courted to help him
undermine and humiliate Obama.

Humiliating Obama
In March 2010, when Obama dispatched Vice President Joseph Biden to Israel in a futile
attempt to restart negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Netanyahu
appeared in Jerusalem at a massive rally of 1,000 evangelicals organized by Texas mega-
church Pastor John Hagee, a leading Christian Zionist and sometime Holocaust revisionist

whose End Times theology committed him to the vision of Greater Israel. Seated onstage
beside Netanyahu was Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren (a
neoconservative former Shalem Center fellow), and Deputy Foreign Minister Danny
Ayalon, who had just snubbed a visiting delegation of leading Democratic members of
Congress. Before the rapture-ready audience, Netanyahu proclaimed that Jerusalem

would remain "the undivided, eternal capital of the Jewish people."
At once, he authorized the construction of 1,600 new settlement units in occupied East
Jerusalemover the stringent objections fromthe Obama administration. Though the move
angered the White House, Ron Dermer, a top Netanyahu aide with close ties to leading
Republicans in Washington,    reassured the Prime Minister that Republicans would retake

Congress. Netanyahu simply rejected Obama's plea to freeze settlements and then
rejected overtures to restart the peace process. In the 2010 mid-term elections,
Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives.
While on a trip to New York days after the Republican victory, Netanyahu authorized
 another 1,000 more settlement units in East Jerusalem, a direct rebuke of Obama. That

 same day, Netanyahu held a meeting with the incoming House Majority Leader Eric
 Cantor, the only Jewish Republican in Congress, and a leader of the right-wing in the
 House Republican Conference. Cantor's office produced a summary of the meeting for the
 media that contained the remarkably crude statement: Cantor promised Netanyahu that
 "the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the [Obama] Administration and

 what has been, up until this point, one party rule in Washington."
 In April 2011, Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner personally invited
 Netanyahu to speak before a joint session of Congress. He was interrupted 36 times by
 standing ovations —more than Obama during his State of the Union address —despite
 making such mind-boggling false claims as that the "vast majority" of Israeli settlers live in

 "neighborhoods in Jerusalemand greater Tel Aviv."
 With a rancorous, multi-billion dollar US presidential campaign certainly looming on the
 horizon, Netanyahu continued his pattern of making friends in the radical right's media
 machine. Among them was Glenn Beck, a Mormon convert and former Fox News host,

 who had compared a major liberal Jewish religious denomination to radical Islamists and
 claimed that Obama has "a deep-seated hatred for white people." Beck was admonished
 by the Anti-Defamation League and other mainstreamJewish groups for his anti-Semitic
 rants against George Soros, a major funder of liberal and Democratic Party-related
 organizations. In July 2011, Beck traveled to Israel to deliver a diatribe against liberal

   <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05788130 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

Israelis demonstrating against Netanyahu's economic policies, labeling thempatsies in a

secret Islamist-Communist plot.
When the right-wing Zionist Organization of America honored Beck this November with a
prize named after Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, Netanyahu displayed his
gratitude in a videotaped tribute. "Glenn, you can be sure that if Sheldon and Miri Adelson

put their name to something, it must stand for a lot. You stand for a lot...And I want to tell
you howdeeply we appreciate this stand of courage and integrity."
Dear Sasha
In December, Thomas. Friedman, the Pulitzer Prize winning     New York Times'   former
JerusalemBureau Chief and one of the few American columnists whose opinions

seriously register in the Israeli media, published an uncharacteristically pointed critique of
Netanyahu's leadership. In Friedman's column were two lines that incited the wrath and
fury of the Prime Minister's office. "I sure hope that Israel's prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, understands that the standing ovation he got in Congress this year was not for

his politics. That ovation was bought and paid for by the Israel lobby."
Neoconservative opinion makers exploded with orchestrated rage accusing Friedman of
being a self-hating Jewish anti-Semite. In response, the  New York Times gave Netanyahu
an opportunity to respond on its opinion page.
But rather than accept the Times' offer, Netanyahu dispatched Ron Dermer, his key

emissary to the American political scene, especially to the conservative movement, now
serving as a senior advisor on his staff, to issue what amounted to a declaration of war
against the American newspaper of record. Dermer's letter was extraordinary in its
vitriolic, hostile and contemptuous tone. Nothing like it had ever existed before —a vicious

official attack fromthe Prime Minister of Israel on the credibility of the New York Times.
Perhaps only a little less surprising was that this major event received nearly no coverage
in the American press.
In his scathing letter, Dermer accused the Times of "cavalierlydefam[ing] our country,"
claiming that 19 out of 20 op-eds published in the  Times were "negative" (Dermer did not

challenge their factual basis). He concluded, "it would seemas if the surest way to get an
op-ed published in the New YorkTimes these days, no matter how obscure the writer or
the viewpoint, is to attack Israel."
One of the remarkable aspects of Dermer's letter was that it was addressed, "Dear
Sasha." Who is Sasha? Sasha Polakow-Suransky, a staff editor at the      Times editorial

page, is in charge of assigning pieces on foreign policy. Why did Dermer address his letter
to Polakow-Suransky instead of to Andrew Rosenthal, the director of the     Times editorial
page? Was he singling out Polakow-Suransky because he revealed in his 2010 book, The
Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Relationship With Apartheid South Africa,    that Israel

offered to sell nuclear warheads to South Africa's apartheid government, a bombshell
revelation that prompted furious denials fromIsraeli President Shimon Peres and Deputy
Prime Minister Dan Meridor, embarrassing a country that still refuses to discuss its nuclear
programin any public forums, and punishes those who do?
Netanyahu's attack on theTimes represented a significant new stage in his shadow war.

He was drawing sharp new lines. By rebuking the paper, Netanyahu attempted to define
its liberal Zionist, pro-peace process editorial line as hostile to Israeli security needs. And
 by default, he positioned Rupert Murdoch's Wall   Street Journal, with its relentlessly anti-
 Obama, pro-Bibi op-ed page, as the only respectable forumfor true friends of Israel.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05788130 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

Bibi's man in Washington
More than any other candidate in the Republican presidential contest, Newt Gingrich has
hewed to Netanyahu's.line on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In an interview with the cable

TV Jewish Channel, Gingrich declared, "We've had an invented Palestinian people who
are in fact Arabs and are historically part of the Arab community and they had a chance to
go many places." He added, "I see myself as, in many ways, to be pretty close to Bibi
Netanyahu in thinking about the dangers of the world."

In May 2010, when Gingrich's presidential campaign was no more than the subject of
guarded speculation,  Israel Hayom,  Bibi's house organ, provided Gingrich with a Hebrew-
language forum to assail Obama's policies. The tabloid splashed a full page photo of a
smiling Gingrich on its front page accompanied by the caption: "The former Chairman of
the House of Representatives attacks the blindness of the Western Elites: 'Evading the

confrontation with Evil may bring a second Holocaust, the mistakes made by the White
House will exact a terrible price.'"
Israel Hayom's  owner, Las Vegas Sands casino corporation chairman Sheldon Adelson, is
America's eighth wealthiest man. At the same time he was bankrolling Netanyahu's
career, Adelson also became Gingrich's leading financial angel. The casino kingpin was

introduced to Gingrich in 1996 through  George Harris,  a right-wing anti-tax activist and
Clark County, Nevada Republican chairman who helped Adelson block a unionization bid
at one of his casinos. Gingrich resigned fromCongress in disgrace in 1999, forced out by
Republicans, hiding his extramarital affair with a congressional staffer. Adelson stepped in
                                             into the coffers of American Solutions for
as his financial godfather,pumping millions
Winning the Future, an independent political committee that covered Gingrich's
extravagant travel expenses.
When Gingrich embarked on the presidential trail, George Harris became his campaign
finance co-chair, representing Adelson by proxy. (Adelson's Sands corporation is currently
facing a federal criminal probe for allegedly bribing foreign officials). And when Gingrich

provoked a hailstormof criticismfor claiming the Palestinians were "invented," Adelson
publicly defended him. "Read the history of those who call themselves Palestinians, and
you will hear why [Newt] Gingrich said recently that the Palestinians are an invented
people," Adelson told a group of American Jews visiting Israel on a programhe funds,

Taglit-Birthright Israel.
Despite Gingrich's dismal finish in the Iowa caucuses, the opening contest in the
Republican contest, Adelson has staunchly remained on his side, donating      US$5 million to
a Super PAC created to support Gingrich's campaign in the key primary state of South
Carolina, his Armageddon.

Bibi's Super PAC
When Gingrich quits the race, Netanyahu will not be without a candidate. He can count on
 former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney to carry the neoconservative banner all the
 way to Election Day. Of Romney's 22 campaign foreign policy advisers, 15 worked in the
 administration of George WBush, and six were original members of the Project for the

 New American Century, the neoconservative group that called for regime change in Iraq.
 Romney's own Super PAC, Restore Our Future, credited with destroying Gingrich's hopes
 in Iowa through a relentless barrage of negative ads, is financed in part by Mel Sembler, a
 Florida-based a multi-millionaire shopping mall developer and veteran Republican
 fundraiser, appointed the US ambassador to Italy by President George W Bush. Sembler

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05788130 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

was mired in scandal when the federal government revoked the license of a chain of
adolescent treatment centers he founded after former teenage patients complained they

were sexually abused, psychologically tortured and humiliated during sadistic behavior
modification programs. Less well known is the financial largesse Sembler has bestowed
on neoconservative outfits supporting Netanyahu's policies. He is also a close friend of
Adelson.
In November 2011, President Obama and French President Nicolas Sarkozy

commiserated about Netanyahu, unaware that their voices were picked up by a live
microphone. "You're fed up with him, but I have to deal with himeven more often than
you," Obama complained to Sarkozy. Romney seized on the episode as proof of Obama's
disqualifying leadership and proof of his own fitness for office. "We have here yet another

reason why we need new leadership in the White House," Romney declared. (Joining the
chorus of pro-Bibi attacks on Obama were the Netanyahu-approved bloggers Breitbart,
Hoft, and Johnson).
In ramping up the effort to turn Israel into an anti-Obama wedge issue, a group of
neoconservative Netanyahu allies have started a independent political committee called

the Emergency Committee for Israel (ECI). The group's name was inspired by the
Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People of Europe, an organization that
Netanyahu's father, Benzion, helped lead during World War II in part to raise money for
the right-wing Irgun militia in Palestine. The group's board comprises a Who's Who of
Washington neoconservatives. It is directed by Noah Pollak, a former assistant editor of

Azure, the in-house journal of the Adelson-funded Shalem Center, several of whose
fellows are now in Netanyahu's inner circle of advisers. Pollak was credited with helping
the Israeli army launch a YouTube channel to rebut accusations that it committed war
crimes in the Gaza Strip and elsewhere.
This month, the ECI established a Super PAC in order to use unlimited corporate

contributions for political attack ads. The group's first major presidential campaign ad buy
targeted Representative Ron Paul (R-Texas), a fervently anti-war libertarian candidate
who has called for an end to the special relationship between Israel and the United States.
Scheduled to air in the key primary state of South Carolina, where the Republican
electorate is dominated by right-wing evangelicals, the ad features Gary Bauer, an ECI

board member, Christian right leader and failed presidential candidate staring into the
camera, warning that "Ron Paul's conservatismis isolationist and conspiratorial." (Bauer
endorsed former Senator Rick Santorum, a right-wing Catholic, who has declared, "All the
people that live in the West Bank are Israelis. They are not Palestinians. There is no
Palestinian. This is Israeli land.")

Jewish concerns
While Obama and the Democratic Party elite have kept silent in the face of Netanyahu's
American shadow war, its polarizing effects have prompted resistance froman
unexpected place: the Jewish-American establishment. Weeks of Republican attacks on
Obama for his supposed molly-coddling of Israel enemies caused deep discomfort in the

offices of mainstreamJewish groups, which have lobbied for decades to consolidate
support for Israel in both major American political parties. With Israel deliberately being
shaped into a campaign wedge issue, some Jewish leaders worried that rank-and-file
 Democratic voters would begin to sour on the US-Israel special relationship.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05788130 Date: 12/31/2015</span>

In October, two of the US's oldest and most prominent Jewish organizations, the Anti-
Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee, released a "National Pledge for

Unity" urging politicians, religious leaders and other Jewish groups aimed at preserving
bipartisan support for Israel. "We want the discourse on US support for Israel to avoid the
sometimes polarizing debates and political attacks that have emerged in recent weeks, as
candidates have challenged their opponents' pro-Israel bone fides or questioned the
current administration's foreign policy approach vis-a-vis Israel," declared Anti-Defamation

League national director Abraham Foxman. "The last thing America and Israel need right
nowis the distractions of having Israel bandied about as a tool for waging political
attacks."
The Emergency Committee for Israel and the Republican Jewish Coalition, an Adelson-

funded, pro-Netanyahu group that claims to raise "tens of millions" of dollars for
Republican candidates each election cycle, not only rejected the unity pledge, but
accused its authors of attempting to suppress pro-Israel activism. In a defiant statement
by its chairman, neoconservative activist WilliamKristol, the ECI proclaimed, "This attempt
to silence those of us who have 'questioned the current administration's foreign policy

approach. vis-a-vis Israel' will re-energize us." Thus the showwent on. The effort to lower
the temperature only became another occasion for the pro-Netanyahu operation to raise
the heat. As their anti-Obama campaign intensifies, Israel is being merged seamlessly
with traditional right-wing wedge issues such as abortion, gay marriage and the menace of
immigration.

The deepening wedge
In his writings and in the company of his inner circle, Netanyahu has expressed almost as
much disdain for liberal Jewish supporters of Israel as he has for the professed enemies
of the Jewish state. His book, A Durable Peace, is filled with attacks on Israeli advocates
of a negotiated peace with the Palestinians, accusing themof "cloying sentimentalism"

and falling victimto the "relentless Jewish desire to see an end to struggle." Netanyahu
was said to privately fume about Obama's Jewish senior advisor, David Axelrod, and his
then-Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, an ardent liberal Zionist whose father was born and
raised in Israel. Netanyahu reportedly called them"self-hating Jews."
After two decades of cultivating the culture warriors of the American right as allies against

those seeking "an end to struggle," Netanyahu is beginning to see results. He initiated and
propelled a polarization process that has enabled Republicans to use Israel as a cudgel
for attacking their opponents, and did so over the objections of powerful mainstream
Jewish-American interests. HaimMalka, a senior fellow for the center-right Washington-
based Center for Strategic and International Studies, predicted in a recent paper: "The

partisan wedge is likely to deepen, posing considerable challenges to Israel and the US-
Israeli partnership."
In the past, America's Israel lobby sold the US-Israel alliance as a marriage of two vibrant
democracies united by shared liberal values. In the current environment of heightened
polarization, the special relationship is increasingly marketed to Americans as a united

front of besieged bastions of Western civilization against an incipient Islamic onslaught.
Rapture ready evangelicals, right-wing ultra-nationalists, and Republican Jews are far
more likely to be attracted to this sort of alliance than cosmopolitan liberals. And this may
be exactly the way Netanyahu wants it.

But he is far fromconfident that he can dislodge Obama. Steeling himself for a possible
second Obama term, Netanyahu has signaled his intention to move up the date of Israel's

national election. Hanan Krystal, a political analyst for Israel Radio, explained Netanyahu's
possible motives to Reuters: "At the highest echelons, they have long been saying that if
Obama is elected for a second term, the carrot will be replaced by a stick."

The U.S. Department of State has made it very clear: The security of information on BlackBerrys is not just about
economics.

It's also, in the words of spokesman P. J. Crowley, "about what we think is an important element of democracy, human
rights and freedom of information ... You should be opening up societies to these new technologies that have the

opportunity to empower people ..."

Canada's government has made, at least in public, no such link between BlackBerrys and democratization. It has not
spoken about the potential for authoritarian governments to abuse monitoring privileges. It has decided the demands

placed on Canadian company Research in Motion by the governments of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
India add up to a business story, not a foreign-affairs story.

This is just one example of a larger political failure in Canada to appreciate the full foreign-policy potential of

communication technology.

In the United States, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called for a "21st-century statecraft" that harnesses tools such
as Twitter and text messages.

Articles this summer in The New York Times Magazine and Foreign Policy have called it "digital diplomacy." Some, such

as Canadian diplomacy expert Daryl Copeland, call it "e-diplomacy."

In 2010, the world sees Canada through YouTube.

"Diplomacy in the international arena is no longer about the big-D diplomat charging in on his white horse and
expounding the virtues of Canada at cocktail parties," says Shauna Sylvester, who was the director of Canada's World, a

three-year non-governmental project consulting citizens about foreign policy.

The United Kingdom's Digital Diplomacy web portal (yes, it has one) defines digital diplomacy as "solving foreign policy
problems using the Internet." Social-media enthusiasts often talk about the wisdom of crowds; post a problem on the

Internet today, and someone, somewhere, will post a solution tomorrow.

No one's likely to craft peace in the Middle East by creating a Facebook page. But Facebook pages, and other social
media, can shift global public opinion in new directions. That, in turn, affects Canada's tourism, trade, security,

immigration.

Canada's government has done some important work in digital diplomacy. "Canada was a pioneer in this field," says
Copeland.

In 2003, for example, Canadian Foreign Minister Bill Graham solicited online comments about policy questions.

In 2005, the government created a virtual network called Connect2Canada.com      "for friends of Canada and Canadians in

the United States." It's still going strong and is a good example of 21st-century government communication, including an
"ask the ambassador" link and a YouTube channel.

More recently, the government created an impressive, if unwieldy, interactive site for the G20 summit. It is also actively

"correcting misinformation" in social media when it comes to the seal hunt.

But Sylvester says the enthusiasm for open government seemed to fade after the Conservatives took office in 2006.
"Engagement was no longer part of the government's role."

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771285 Date: 08/31/2015</span>

There are people who get it in the public service today, and some very good initiatives. There are even a few ministers
who get Twitter. But there is no Hillary Clinton pushing the government to do better, no office of digital diplomacy

working on a strategy.

How we do it is almost as important as whether we do it at all. The tactic the government has taken on the seal hunt, for
example, could have the intended effect of countering inaccuracy, or it could come across as a heavy-handed attempt to
control the debate, especially if the government's not simultaneously engaged in more crowd-pleasing ways to get its

message across. Some governments have had fun with social media, opening virtual embassies on Second Life, for
example.

Wikipedia  edits are another tricky area. As for seeding Twitter and the blogosphere with Canadian values, it has to be

done with care. Security analyst Peter Jones points out that if, for example, an Iranian blogger becomes too closely
associated with the West, his or her credibility could suffer.

The field of digital diplomacy is new, and fraught with risks. The opportunities, though, are exciting.

In that New York  Times Magazine article, Alec Ross, Clinton's senior adviser for innovation, said the key question for
21st-century statecraft is "Is it open or is it closed?" That's a sensitive question for this Conservative government.

A real advance in e-diplomacy, a real engagement in the split-second, wide-open, on-the-record world of Twitter and
Wikipedia, requires a prime minister who is willing to let public servants and diplomats have a constant unmediated

conversation with the public. It means relinquishing central control of the message.

The alternative is to fade into irrelevance. Because that big, messy, whirlwind global conversation's going to happen

anyway, whether Canada's part of it or not.

  The Empty Chamber

  Just how broken is the Senate?

• Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
  haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the

  Obama Administration....
  The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills

  passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate....

  "Sit and watch us for seven days," one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. "You know what you'll see happening?

  Nothing."

  "This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'"

  Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.
  "It's unconscionable," Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. "The obstructionism has become

  mindless."
  The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly

  behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and
  top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.

  "Also, it's a dumb rule in itself," McCaskill said. "It's time we started looking at some of these rules."
  She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and

  subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had
  scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general

  and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and
  McCaskill's Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training

  of Afghan police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a
  victory ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-

  care reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most
  embarrassing sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who

  had fought the bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775722 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard
Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. "I have no personal objection to

continuing," Burr said. But, he added, "there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object."
Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In

general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be
present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their

first look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The
presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce

them to the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about
the Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, "Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the

floor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they're
doing in China right now?"

Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name
every few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the

press lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of
interest actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers.

On this afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the
transcription machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate

chamber is an intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.
Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to

hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some
built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority

and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,
"Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and

not be distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule."
The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon;

the general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators
these days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-

term successes while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.
Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three

amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an
amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch

the amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was
to finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the

only thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty
minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to

yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,
would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.

 Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, "This is the first time in recent
 memory that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to

 kill the reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are
defeated."

Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. "The position on the other side
of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good," he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose

 half an octave. "Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an
 inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an

 inconvenience."
 The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded

 Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to
 emphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides

 the chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third
 person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the

 moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's "Manual of

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775722 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

Parliamentary Practice"—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from
insulting any senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting

at Al Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: "Mr. President, make no mistake, the
intent of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform.... A

senator on the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill
health-care reform!"

The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: "The time of the senator has expired."
For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that

happens on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the
Democrats while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that

it wouldn't have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had
been designed to make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically

supports. One amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on
individuals making less than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and

outlandish. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom
Coburn, a Republican obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with

mental illness would not be denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent "convicted child molesters, rapists,
and sex offenders" from buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was

allotted to explain his Viagra amendment without cracking a smile. "This is not a game amendment," he insisted. "It
actually saves money."

So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.
"The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate," Baucus declared. "It is a crass

political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy." Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a
clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. "Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins." Thirty-five-second pause. "Mr. Conrad, Mr.

Corker." Ten seconds. "Mr. Cornyn." Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they're
so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues

milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John
McCain—now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed,

trying to catch the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben
Nelson, of Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.

The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled
drone was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, "Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!"

Sporadically, a sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could
charm into laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo

animals—Levin a shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one
displayed a limited set of behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and

clamped his hands down on a colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which
senators were loners (Russ Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which

senators were important (Dick Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).
Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through

her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. "Can we
get some order?" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It

was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.
 Harry Reid controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.

Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous
 negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,

 unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was
 hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the

 chamber to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow,

of Michigan, her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion
 momentarily eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face,
 as if casting her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, "The longest it lasted was thirty

 seconds."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775722 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just
found two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the

bill would go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the
Capitol's northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty

streets. On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if
waiting for someone to take him away.

The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the
Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. "Everyone's

tired," Reid declared before the final vote. "This legislative fight is one for the record books." He was so fatigued that he

initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. "Way to go, Lindsey, way
to stretch it out," Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the

losing team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a
moment the chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.

The Senate is often referred to as "the world's greatest deliberative body." Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from
Oregon, said, "That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of

exchange of ideas, is so limited." Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a
 Republican and a Democrat. "The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation occurring

 in which they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber."
Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.

"You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue," he said.
 Instead, a senator typically gives "a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets

 up and gives a speech on a completely different subject." From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a
colloquy—"I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantage

 plan"—that has been scripted in advance by aides.
 While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits
 from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.

 Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same
 morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a

 hearing can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an
 unwritten rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows

 senators to spend four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their
 families in their home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless

 fund-raising, and to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the
 House, in 1995, he told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former

 Democratic leader, said, "When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one
 hundred senators there was W ednesday afternoon."

 Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, "Of any free
 time you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more," is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own

 campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on
 behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate

 office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee
 Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, "It sucks up time that a

 senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues."
 In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took

 time to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a
 million dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry

 groups were spending $1.4 million a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-
 raising and lobbying, said, "People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The

•over-all bills are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money."
 Daschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: "Sometimes, you're dialling for

 dollars, you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the
 floor, your staff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double

 check—but, just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775722 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

vote, or a no vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up
sometimes. But, if you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope

nobody asks, because I don't have a clue."
Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past

few decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff
members, who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional
relationships, tend to push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—

writing bills, negotiating the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox or MSNBC.
One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. "You know about all
these rags that cover the Hill, right?" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, CongressDaily,

and CQ Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of
the "24/7 media," provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a "dust-up" between Scott
Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South

Carolina; the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront
DeMint on the Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators
have a young press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of

political obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go
unreported because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to
the Senate in 1981 and will leave next January, told me, "I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who

covered me on a daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications
only see me through the prism of conflict." Lamar Alexander described the effect as "this instant radicalizing of positions

to the left and the right."
Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had     been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly
fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan coOperation is still

permissible. "A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution," Gregg said. "Substantive,
thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside."
Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus
lunch to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one

another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses
who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill
Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall

 has set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the
seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: "In those days Democrats and

 Republicans actually enjoyed each other's company.") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim
 DeMint, Dodd said, "Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well." He repeated something that
Jon Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: "There's no trust." Dodd, whose father was a

senator, went on, "That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with
 that conclusion. And if that's missing ... "
 There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party

 as "friends." Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as "one of my best friends in the Senate,"
 and both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with
 Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining.

 Udall noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But
 opportunities to bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the "inner
 sanctum," where Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the

 seventies, old bulls such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick
 Moynihan did. "You learned, and also you found out what was going on," Dodd said, adding, "It's awfully difficult to say
 crappy things about someone that you just had lunch with." These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty.

 Senators eat lunch in their respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else "downtown," which means
 asking donors for money over steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the "caucus lunch"
 was instituted by Republicans in the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980,

 followed suit. Caucus lunches work members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775722 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry Reid as an idiot. "At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors,"

Alexander joked, adding, "We spend most of our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other."

In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. "They kind of dwindled off during
the health-care debate," Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few

months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,
joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.

These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers
who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson,

of Wisconsin, put it this way: "Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?"
The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.

The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.
For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a

levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply
impressed by the quality of its members: "They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous

instincts animating it, not the petty passions." But he also recognized that "a minority of the nation dominating the
Senate could completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the

spirit of constitutional government." As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented
statesmen, Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.

Robert A. Caro, in "Master of the Senate," the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War
the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster,

Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the
Presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of

Southern racists and Republican corporate shills, and was "the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed
themselves in vain—the chief obstructive force in the federal government." By the fifties, the Senate had become far

more conservative than the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book "Citadel," called the
Senate "to a most peculiar degree, a Southern Institution ... growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly"

and "the only place in the country where the South did not lose the war."
By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise and

Consent," based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and
Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works,

in its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one
another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-

raisers, no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.
In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's "famous 'club' atmosphere is

based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand.... They thrust
hard at one another in debate over serious matters," but, he writes, "understanding and accommodation in the ordinary

course of the Senate day was essential to sanity." Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the
Senate to his will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either "whales"—the heavyweight

chairmen who negotiated legislation—or "minnows," the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when,
in 1958, a formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy,

and Philip Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of "The Fall of the
House of Roosevelt," worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. "They used to talk to each other—

that's my most vivid recollection," he said. "If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners
would come in to hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a

deliberative body, drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically." Senators who ran for office in order to work on
foreign policy, social welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. "But if you wanted to do something

there was a mechanism by which you could do it," Janeway said.
In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and

moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of
those decades as "a bipartisan liberal institution." The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the

Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,
campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775722 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was
passed, in 1965, it won 70-24.

The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church,
Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan "field

hearings" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole's indispensable support,
greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's

legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and
said, "You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That's

how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly." Humphrey's career advice: "You should become Mr. Housing.
Housing is the future."

The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and
accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. "The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of

people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs," Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled.
"They were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to

Republicans in the Senate today." Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,

who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, "It was a huge loss of the most experienced,
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there
less than six years." He added, "The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets

worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others
didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'"

After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals
began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. "So Damn Much Money," a recent book by the Washington Post

reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans
began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan

coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own
fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members

of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to
regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in

the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and
escalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats

filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-
called "nuclear option." Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went

to South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years
earlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.

The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,
 independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that

every election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The
Senate, no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main

 action was between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican
Senate majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.

 Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly
 become populated by "ideologues and charlatans." He went on, "When we do get good people who come in, they very

 quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay
 there." He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year

 working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with
 angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about "pulling the plug

 on Grandma." Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin "altering his behavior and
 abandoning every issue, including campaign-finance reform."

 One morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.
 A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the

 111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger
 down the list of senators. He did it again. "I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775722 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

He was stumped. "Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time."

He put the directory aside. "I'm just having the damnedest time."
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was

hired last year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to

JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm's chairman, until

President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with
which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became

lobbyists. In 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned
and formed a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a

two-year waiting period between serving and lobbying.
When you spend your days at the Senate, it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems

miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute

thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says "Men's Gallery"), and

the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where
senators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over

the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.
Riddick, called "Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices," which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was

known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding
officer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.

After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's "Advise and Consent" is still faintly visible. "The Senate, by its
nature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount," Lamar Alexander said. "And that's

not changed." Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its
members to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, "To have a chamber

that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please."
In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one

(counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia;
liberals, like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of

Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of
senior senators. "If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific," Chris Dodd said. "My worry is they won't stay. Because it's

not productive."
The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in a dynamic new era. Instead, their

young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and "secret holds"—when a senator
anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire

McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds,
and Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical

gamesmanship between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first
year. Michael Bennet said, "We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small

ones, and where things have been put off for a really long period of time." He mentioned the national debt, energy
 policy, and the financial crisis. "Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it."

 We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with
 bottled water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was

 moving. Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already
 has to defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to

grow too attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: "And
 then some more veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.'

 As the fifteen months or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems."
 Earlier this year, the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th,

 CongressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy
 Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office

 maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775722 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

several days and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of

unemployed Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, "Tough shit." (Eventually,
Republicans persuaded Bunning to stop.)

These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,

Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In
2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more

senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called "rolling holds"—and their party leader facilitates the game by
keeping their names secret.

Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of
partisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed

time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-
authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used

rule that allowed the "previous question" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by
the eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and

talking until their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word "filibuster" comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for "looter.")
In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,

which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a "cloture" vote. For decades, the rule was
rarely used; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies

and eighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower
the threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a

year, as both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the
Republicans lost their majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture

votes in 2007 and 2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills

passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. "Why?" Steny Hoyer, the
outraged Democratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. "Because they do not do their business in a way that

facilitates noncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate." Last week, six
House Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.

Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the

Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to

run the General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection
was substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's "Senate Procedure" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and

vote. Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading
aloud of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist;

Senate clerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in
frustration.

Under McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative
maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first

proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues "nihilists," who want to create chaos because
it serves their ideology. "If there's chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions," Harkin said. "In chaos people don't

listen to reason." McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican
strategy reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times, "To the extent that they"—the

Democrats—"want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be
helpful. To the extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful."

One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after
vote. Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana;

Susan Collins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus?
Alexander said that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, "When you have your back against the wall and

the gallows are hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind."
Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: "He said

if we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant." Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775722 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

a military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad
Cochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that

he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with

the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose
cloture, and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)

Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus
bill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-

care-reform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against
the version that went before the full Senate. "I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance

Committee version—it grew by a thousand pages," Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White
House officials that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices, and said that the

Democrats "did not accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch." McConnell

was able to exploit her alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: "She actually said to me once
that she had never felt the pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to

her or quite as real or troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this
together. You're a senior Republican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and

you're going to do it.'"
Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the

senator who helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn't give him the leverage

of McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.
In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per

cent of the country's population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a
few new senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.

Tom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent
time in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior

Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,

in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.
"I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas," he said. "Then to be on the inside—the

thing that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show."
In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.

Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend
them, making it extremely difficult. ("Rule XXII is a Catch-22," Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different

idea—the "constitutional option." Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that "each House may determine the
Rules of its Proceedings" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January

and propose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority.
There's even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three

times, most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.
At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings

on the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized

working groups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee
chairs by caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were

competing for the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other
for Majority Leader.)

 For Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. "If you want a
 parliamentary form of government, go over to the House," Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. "Why even run for the

Senate?" Udall's plan for next January, he said, would be a "gigantic mistake."
"They'll get over it," Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. "And they'll get over it quicker if

 they're in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider
 whatever they have to say." He added that the Senate "may be getting done about as much as the American people

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775722 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

want done." The President's ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of

the Republicans I spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is "broken." Alexander claimed that he and other
Republicans were exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate.

"The Senate wasn't created to be efficient," he argued. "It was created to be inefficient." At one of the filibuster
hearings, in April, Alexander, sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the

Republicans with obstructing legislation, "we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our
right to debate, our right to offer amendments, which is the essence of the Senate."

Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah

Binder, a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the
filibuster, and so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. "I would oppose that," Chris Dodd said, adding of

the freshmen, "These are people who have never been in the minority." For older Democrats, who have put in their
years, grown adept at working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat.

(Among senior senators, the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being
divided not between whales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too

accustomed to the Senate's ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate
Republicans are too weak to challenge the newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.

Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic,
wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,

who have created a culture where Tocqueville's "lofty thoughts" and "generous impulses" have no place.
A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial

regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout

Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and

evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to pass
a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.

The affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first
term, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of

Virginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having
to do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They

worked through the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were
 members of a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke,

Alan Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still
talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate's "Odd Couple." By February, they had finished

their work.
 Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,

 dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the
 committee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed

 McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. "It was an odd place to be," Corker recalled. "And yet that night we
 began meeting." The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In

 response, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their
 lobbyists that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other

 Republicans of the Party's line on financial reform.)
 On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, "You've been a great

 partner." He was ending their talks after only a month. "It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest," Corker told reporters
 afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the

 rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks
 under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other

 Republicans with him. "Baloney," Corker said. "If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we'd've had at least twenty-
 five Republican votes."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775722 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike,
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar

fund, paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of
another crisis. But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was

now parroting talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a "partisan bill"
that "will guarantee perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks." McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-

one Republicans, suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded

with his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, "Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the
rhetoric. Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do.... W e were

supposed to be the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat
down with cooler heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot

do that on financial regulation, an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it ..." Corker didn't
allow the thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.

Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: "I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced
with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I

am not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue ... then
why are we even here?" He went on, "We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is

looking out for their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority
seems intent on proving them right....1 have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know

there are friends of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate,
who want to be part of the solution."

In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted, "I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four

or five months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it.... I
have to say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!"

Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. "You and I went a long
way," Corker told Dodd. "Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats

on your committee."
"And I was not gaining Republicans," Dodd replied.

"You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did
not leave the table." Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few

days.
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-

reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists
prowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the

ornate Reception Room with Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of
furniture scraping across a tile floor. "Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room," Manley said. "Very little happens

around here without a deadline." The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A
few weeks later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform

finally came to a vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He
had even voted for an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have

scrapped Corker's work of many months with Warner.
"The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained

office, under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. "It's the Senate, I guess." McConnell's strategy of obstruction
had once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a "shrinking number" of Republicans were

frustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, "God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking
member on this." Collins responded, "We could have had such a great time on this bill."

Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because "the American people don't trust either political party
enough to give them a blank check," was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. "There was zero

substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes," he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the
bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, "If you want to vote against something,

you can always find your reasons."

•	   <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775722 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating
himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of

thirty minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. "I am obviously disappointed," he said. "I think I have
spent as much time as any senator.  ... on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good

things in it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not
enough time was spent on some of the core issues."

As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of "So Damn Much Money," in the press gallery. I
later asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of

the Senate. "If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away
money and interest groups," he said. "But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things

considered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here
you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet."

After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,
smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, "For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it

didn't work." He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with "some Nevadans."
Durbin said, "I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take

to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?"
Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, "I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its

business much as our founders intended. We did that."
On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial

regulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They

depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,

Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the
year. And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign

finance, transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial
appointments on the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you

can feel the Senate slipping back into stagnant waters.

The Empty Chamber

Just how broken is the Senate?

Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,

haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration....

The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills
passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate....

"Sit and watch us for seven days," one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. "You know what you'll see happening?
Nothing."

"This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'"
Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.

"It's unconscionable," Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. "The obstructionism has become
mindless."

The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly
behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and

top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.
"Also, it's a dumb rule in itself," McCaskill said. "It's time we started looking"at some of these rules."

She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and
subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had

scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general
and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and

McCaskill's Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training
of Afghan police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a

victory ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-
care reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most

embarrassing sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who
 had fought the bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.

      <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775717 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard
Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. "I have no personal objection to

continuing," Burr said. But, he added, "there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object."
Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In

general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be
present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their

first look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The

presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce
them to the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about

the Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, "Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the
floor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they're
doing in China right now?"

Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name

every few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the
press lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of

interest actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers.
On this afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the

transcription machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate
chamber is an intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.

Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to
hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some

built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority
and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,

"Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and
not be distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule."

The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon;
the general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators

these days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-
term successes while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.

Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three
amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an

amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch
the amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was

to finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the
only thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty

minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to
yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,

would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.
Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, "This is the first time in recent

memory that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to
kill the reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are

defeated."
Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. "The position on the other side

of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good," he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose
half an octave. "Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an

inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an
inconvenience."

The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded
Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to

emphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides
the chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third

person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the
moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's "Manual of

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775717 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

Parliamentary Practice"—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from
insulting any senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting

at Al Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: "Mr. President, make no mistake, the
intent of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform.... A

senator on the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill
health-care reform!"

The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: "The time of the senator has expired."
For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that

happens on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the
Democrats while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that

it wouldn't have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had
been designed to make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically

supports. One amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on
individuals making less than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and

outlandish. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom
Coburn, a Republican obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with

mental illness would not be denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent "convicted child molesters, rapists,
and sex offenders" from buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was

allotted to explain his Viagra amendment without cracking a smile. "This is not a game amendment," he insisted. "It
actually saves money."

So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.
"The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate," Baucus declared. "It is a crass

political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy." Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a
clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. "Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins." Thirty-five-second pause. "Mr. Conrad, Mr.

Corker." Ten seconds. "Mr. Cornyn." Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they're
so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues

milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John
McCain—now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed,

trying to catch the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben
Nelson, of Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.

The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled
drone was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, "Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!"

Sporadically, a sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could
charm into laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo

animals—Levin a shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one
displayed a limited set of behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and

clamped his hands down on a colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which
senators were loners (Russ Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which

senators were important (Dick Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).
Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through

her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. "Can we
get some order?" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It

was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.
 Harry Reid controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.

Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous
 negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,

 unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was
 hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the

chamber to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow,
of Michigan, her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion

 momentarily eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face,

 as if casting her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, "The longest it lasted was thirty
seconds."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775717 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just
found two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the

bill would go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the

Capitol's northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty
streets. On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if

waiting for someone to take him away.
The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the

Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. "Everyone's
tired," Reid declared before the final vote. "This legislative fight is one for the record books." He was so fatigued that he

initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. "Way to go, Lindsey, way
to stretch it out," Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the

losing team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a
moment the chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.

The Senate is often referred to as "the world's greatest deliberative body." Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from
Oregon, said, "That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of

exchange of ideas, is so limited." Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a
Republican and a Democrat. "The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation occurring

in which they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber."
Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.

"You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue," he said.
Instead, a senator typically gives "a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets

up and gives a speech on a completely different subject." From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a
colloquy—"I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantage

plan"—that has been scripted in advance by aides.
While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits

from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.
Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same

morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a
hearing can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an

unwritten rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows
senators to spend four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their

families in their home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless
fund-raising, and to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the

 House, in 1995, he told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former
 Democratic leader, said, "When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one

 hundred senators there was W ednesday afternoon."
 Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, "Of any free
time you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more," is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own

 campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on

 behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate
 office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee
 Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, "It sucks up time that a

 senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues."
 In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took

 time to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a
 million dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry

 groups were spending $1.4 million a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-
 raising and lobbying, said, "People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The

 over-all bills are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money."
 Daschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: "Sometimes, you're dialling for

 dollars, you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the
 floor, your staff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double

 check—but, just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775717 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

vote, or a no vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up
sometimes. But, if you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope

nobody asks, because I don't have a clue."
Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past

few decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff
members, who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional

relationships, tend to push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—
writing bills, negotiating the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox or MSNBC.

One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. "You know about all
these rags that cover the Hill, right?" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, CongressDaily,

and CQ Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of
the "24/7 media," provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a "dust-up" between Scott

Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South
Carolina; the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront

DeMint on the Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators

have a young press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of
political obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go

unreported because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to
the Senate in 1981 and will leave next January, told me, "I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who
covered me on a daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications

only see me through the prism of conflict." Lamar Alexander described the effect as "this instant radicalizing of positions

to the left and the right."
Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly

fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan cooperation is still
permissible. "A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution," Gregg said. "Substantive,
thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside."

Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus
lunch to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one

another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses
who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill

Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall
has set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the

seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: "In those days Democrats and
Republicans actually enjoyed each other's company.") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim

DeMint, Dodd said, "Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well." He repeated something that
Jon Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: "There's no trust." Dodd, whose father was a

senator, went on, "That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with
that conclusion. And if that's missing ..."

There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party
as "friends." Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as "one of my best friends in the Senate,"

and both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with

Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining.
Udall noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But
opportunities to bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the "inner

sanctum," where Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the

seventies, old bulls such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick
 Moynihan did. "You learned, and also you found out what was going on," Dodd said, adding, "It's awfully difficult to say

crappy things about someone that you just had lunch with." These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty.
Senators eat lunch in their respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else "downtown," which means

asking donors for money over steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the "caucus lunch"
was instituted by Republicans in the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980,

followed suit. Caucus lunches work members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775717 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry Reid as an idiot. "At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors,"
Alexander joked, adding, "We spend most of our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other."

In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. "They kind of dwindled off during
the health-care debate," Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few

months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,
joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.

These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers
who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson,

of Wisconsin, put it this way: "Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?"
The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.

The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.
For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a

levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply
impressed by the quality of its members: "They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous

instincts animating it, not the petty passions." But he also recognized that "a minority of the nation dominating the
Senate could completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the

spirit of constitutional government." As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented
statesmen, Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.

Robert A. Caro, in "Master of the Senate," the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War
the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster,

Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the
Presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of

Southern racists and Republican corporate shills, and was "the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed
themselves in vain—the chief obstructive force in the federal government." By the fifties, the Senate had become far

more conservative than the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book "Citadel," called the
Senate "to a most peculiar degree, a Southern Institution ... growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly"

and "the only place in the country where the South did not lose the war."
By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise and

Consent," based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and
Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works,

in its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one
another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-

raisers, no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.
In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's "famous 'club' atmosphere is

based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand.... They thrust
hard at one another in debate over serious matters," but, he writes, "understanding and accommodation in the ordinary

course of the Senate day was essential to sanity." Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the
Senate to his will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either "whales"—the heavyweight

chairmen who negotiated legislation—or "minnows," the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when,
in 1958, a formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy,

and Philip Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of "The Fall of the
 House of Roosevelt," worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. "They used to talk to each other—

that's my most vivid recollection," he said. "If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners
would come in to hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a

deliberative body, drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically." Senators who ran for office in order to work on
foreign policy, social welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. "But if you wanted to do something

there was a mechanism by which you could do it," Janeway said.
 In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and

 moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of
those decades as "a bipartisan liberal institution." The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the

 Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,

 campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775717 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

 jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was
 passed, in 1965, it won 70-24.

The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church,

 Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan "field
 hearings" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole's indispensable support,

greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's
 legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and

said, "You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That's
 how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly." Humphrey's career advice: "You should become Mr. Housing.

 Housing is the future."
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and

accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. "The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of
 people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs," Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled.

"They were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to
 Republicans in the Senate today." Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,

 who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, "It was a huge loss of the most experienced,
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there

 less than six years." He added, "The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets
 worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others

 didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'"
 After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals

 began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. "So Damn Much Money," a recent book by the Washington Post
 reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans

 began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan
 coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own
 fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members

 of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to
 regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in

 the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and
 escalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats

 filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-
 called "nuclear option." Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went

 to South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years
 earlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.

 The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,
 independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that

 every election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The
 Senate, no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main

 action was between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican
 Senate majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.

 Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly
 become populated by "ideologues and charlatans." He went on, "When we do get good people who come in, they very

 quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay
 there." He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year

 working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with
 angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about "pulling the plug

 on Grandma." Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin "altering his behavior and
•abandoning every issue, including campaign-finance reform."

 One morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.
 A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the

 111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger
 down the list of senators. He did it again. "I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775717 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

He was stumped. "Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time."

He put the directory aside. "I'm just having the damnedest time."
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was

hired last year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to
JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom

Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm's chairman, until
President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with

which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became
lobbyists. In 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned

and formed a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a
two-year waiting period between serving and lobbying.

When you spend your days at the Senate, it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems
miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign

countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute
thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution

Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says "Men's Gallery"), and
the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where

senators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over
the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.

Riddick, called "Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices," which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was
known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding

officer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.
After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's "Advise and Consent" is still faintly visible. "The Senate, by its

nature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount," Lamar Alexander said. "And that's
not changed." Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its

members to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, "To have a chamber
that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please."

In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one
(counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia;

liberals, like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of
Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of

senior senators. "If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific," Chris Dodd said. "My worry is they won't stay. Because it's
not productive."

The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in a dynamic new era. Instead, their
young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and "secret holds"—when a senator

anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire
McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds,

and Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical
gamesmanship between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first
year. Michael Bennet said, "We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small

ones, and where things have been put off for a really long period of time." He mentioned the national debt, energy

 policy, and the financial crisis. "Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it."
 We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with
 bottled water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was

 moving. Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already
 has to defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to

 grow too attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: "And
 then some more veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.'

 As the fifteen months or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems."
 Earlier this year, the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th,

 CongressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy
 Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office

 maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775717 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

several days and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of
unemployed Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, "Tough shit." (Eventually,

Republicans persuaded Bunning to stop.)
These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,

Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In
2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more

senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called "rolling holds"—and their party leader facilitates the game by
keeping their names secret.

Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of

partisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed
time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-

authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used
rule that allowed the "previous question" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by

the eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and
talking until their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word "filibuster" comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for "looter.")

In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,
which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a "cloture" vote. For decades, the rule was

rarely used; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies
and eighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower

the threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a
year, as both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the

Republicans lost their majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture
votes in 2007 and 2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.

The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills
passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. "Why?" Steny Hoyer, the

outraged Democratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. "Because they do not do their business in a way that
facilitates noncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate." Last week, six

House Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,

haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)

There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to
run the General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection

was substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's "Senate Procedure" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and
vote. Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading

aloud of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist;
Senate clerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in

frustration.
Under McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative

maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first
proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues "nihilists," who want to create chaos because

it serves their ideology. "If there's chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions," Harkin said. "In chaos people don't
 listen to reason." McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican

strategy reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times, "To the extent that they"—the
 Democrats—"want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be

 helpful. To the extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful."
One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after

vote. Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana;
Susan Collins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus?

Alexander said that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, "When you have your back against the wall and
the gallows are hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind."

 Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: "He said
 if we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant." Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775717 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

a military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad
Cochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that

he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with

the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose
cloture, and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)

Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus
bill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-

care-reform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against
the version that went before the full Senate. "I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance

Committee version—it grew by a thousand pages," Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White
House officials that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices, and said that the

Democrats "did not accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch." McConnell

was able to exploit her alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: "She actually said to me once
that she had never felt the pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to

her or quite as real or troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this
together. You're a senior Republican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and
you're going to do it.'"

Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the

senator who helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn't give him the leverage
of McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.

In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per

cent of the country's population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a
few new senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.

Tom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent
time in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior

Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,

in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.
"I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas," he said. "Then to be on the inside—the
thing that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show."

In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.

Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend
them, making it extremely difficult. ("Rule XXII is a Catch-22," Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different
idea—the "constitutional option." Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that "each House may determine the

Rules of its Proceedings" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January

and propose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority.
There's even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three
times, most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.

At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings

on the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized

working groups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee
chairs by caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were

competing for the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other
for Majority Leader.)

For Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. "If you want a
parliamentary form of government, go over to the House," Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. "Why even run for the

Senate?" Udall's plan for next January, he said, would be a "gigantic mistake."
"They'll get over it," Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. "And they'll get over it quicker if

they're in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider
whatever they have to say." He added that the Senate "may be getting done about as much as the American people

want done." The President's ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of

the Republicans I spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is "broken." Alexander claimed that he and other
Republicans were exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate.

"The Senate wasn't created to be efficient," he argued. "It was created to be inefficient." At one of the filibuster
hearings, in April, Alexander, sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the

Republicans with obstructing legislation, "we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our
right to debate, our right to offer amendments, which is the essence of the Senate."

Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah

Binder, a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the
filibuster, and so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. "I would oppose that," Chris Dodd said, adding of

the freshmen, "These are people who have never been in the minority." For older Democrats, who have put in their
years, grown adept at working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat.

(Among senior senators, the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being
divided not between whales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too

accustomed to the Senate's ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate
Republicans are too weak to challenge the newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.

Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic,
wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,

who have created a culture where Tocqueville's "lofty thoughts" and "generous impulses" have no place.
A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial

regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout

Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and

evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to pass
a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.
The affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first

term, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of

Virginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having
to do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They

worked through the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were
members of a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke,

Alan Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still
talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate's "Odd Couple." By February, they had finished

their work.
 Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,

dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the
committee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed

 McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. "It was an odd place to be," Corker recalled. "And yet that night we
 began meeting." The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In

 response, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their
 lobbyists that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other

 Republicans of the Party's line on financial reform.)
 On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, "You've been a great

 partner." He was ending their talks after only a month. "It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest," Corker told reporters
 afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the

 rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks
 under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other

 Republicans with him. "Baloney," Corker said. "If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we'd've had at least twenty-
 five Republican votes."

     <span class="unclassified">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775717 Date: 09/30/2015</span>

The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike,
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar

fund, paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of
another crisis. But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was

now parroting talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a "partisan bill"
that "will guarantee perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks." McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-

one Republicans, suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.

His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded
with his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, "Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the

rhetoric. Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do.... W e were
supposed to be the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat

down with cooler heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot
do that on financial regulation, an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it ..." Corker didn't

allow the thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.
Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: "I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced

with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I
am not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue ... then

why are we even here?" He went on, "We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is
looking out for their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority

seems intent on proving them right.... I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know
there are friends of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate,

who want to be part of the solution."
In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he

chopped the air with his hand as he shouted, "I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four
or five months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it.... I

have to say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!"
Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. "You and I went a long
way," Corker told Dodd. "Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats

on your committee."
"And I was not gaining Republicans," Dodd replied.

"You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did
not leave the table." Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few

days.
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-

reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists
prowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the

ornate Reception Room with Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of
furniture scraping across a tile floor. "Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room," Manley said. "Very little happens

around here without a deadline." The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A
few weeks later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform

finally came to a vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He
 had even voted for an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have

scrapped Corker's work of many months with Warner.
"The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained

 office, under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. "It's the Senate, I guess." McConnell's strategy of obstruction
 had once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a "shrinking number" of Republicans were

 frustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, "God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking
 member on this." Collins responded, "We could have had such a great time on this bill."

 Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because "the American people don't trust either political party
 enough to give them a blank check," was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. "There was zero

 substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes," he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the
 bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, "If you want to vote against something,

 you can always find your reasons."

But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating
himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of

thirty minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. "I am obviously disappointed," he said. "I think I have
spent as much time as any senator.... on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good

things in it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not
enough time was spent on some of the core issues."

As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of "So Damn Much Money," in the press gallery. I
later asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of

the Senate. "If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away
money and interest groups," he said. "But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things

considered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here

you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet."
After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,

smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, "For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it
didn't work." He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with "some Nevadans."

Durbin said, "I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take
to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?"

Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, "I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its
business much as our founders intended. We did that."

On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial
regulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They

depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,

Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the
year. And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign
finance, transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial

appointments on the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you
can feel the Senate slipping back into stagnant waters.
